An example is the compareTo method: a.compareTo(b) checks whether a comes before or after b in some ordering, but the way to compare, say, two rational numbers will be different from the way to compare two strings. Other common examples of binary methods include equality tests, arithmetic operations, and set operations like subset and union."
29080,c# this in method parameter,50388,"Giuseppe Castagna observed that in a typed language with multiple dispatch, a generic function can have some parameters which control dispatch and some ""left-over"" parameters which do not. Because the method selection rule chooses the most specific applicable method, if a method overrides another method, then the overriding method will have more specific types for the controlling parameters. On the other hand, to ensure type safety the language still must require the left-over parameters to be at least as general. Using the previous terminology, types used for runtime method selection are covariant while types not used for runtime method selection of the method are contravariant. Conventional single-dispatch languages like Java also obey this rule: only one argument is used for method selection (the receiver object, passed along to a method as the hidden argument this), and indeed the type of this is more specialized inside overriding methods than in the superclass."

29081,cluster plot in r,50393,"As all the stars of a globular cluster are at approximately the same distance from the Earth, their absolute magnitudes differ from their visual magnitude by about the same amount. The main-sequence stars in the globular cluster will fall along a line that is believed to be comparable to similar stars in the solar neighborhood. The accuracy of this assumption is confirmed by comparable results obtained by comparing the magnitudes of nearby short-period variables, such as RR Lyrae stars and cepheid variables, with those in the cluster.By matching up these curves on the HR diagram the absolute magnitude of main-sequence stars in the cluster can also be determined. This in turn provides a distance estimate to the cluster, based on the visual magnitude of the stars. The difference between the relative and absolute magnitude, the distance modulus, yields this estimate of the distance.When the stars of a particular globular cluster are plotted on an HR diagram, in many cases nearly all of the stars fall upon a relatively well-defined curve. This differs from the HR diagram of stars near the Sun, which lumps together stars of differing ages and origins. The shape of the curve for a globular cluster is characteristic of a grouping of stars that were formed at approximately the same time and from the same materials, differing only in their initial mass. As the position of each star in the HR diagram varies with age, the shape of the curve for a globular cluster can be used to measure the overall age of the star population.However, the above-mentioned historic process of determining the age and distance to globular clusters is not as robust as first thought, since the morphology and luminosity of globular cluster stars in color-magnitude diagrams are influenced by numerous parameters, many of which are still being actively researched. Certain clusters even display populations that are absent from other globular clusters (e.g., blue hook stars), or feature multiple populations.  The historical paradigm that all globular clusters consist of stars born at exactly the same time, or sharing exactly the same chemical abundance, has likewise been overturned (e.g., NGC 2808). Further, the morphology of the cluster stars in a color-magnitude diagram, and that includes the brightnesses of distance indicators such as RR Lyrae variable members, can be influenced by observational biases. One such effect is called blending, and it arises because the cores of globular clusters are so dense that in low-resolution observations multiple (unresolved) stars may appear as a single target. Thus the brightness measured for that seemingly single star (e.g., an RR Lyrae variable) is erroneously too bright, given those unresolved stars contributed to the brightness determined.  Consequently, the computed distance is wrong, and more importantly, certain researchers have argued that the blending effect can introduce a systematic uncertainty into the cosmic distance ladder, and may bias the estimated age of the Universe and the Hubble constant."

29082,poisson regression vs linear regression,50400,"In statistics, Poisson regression is a generalized linear model form of regression analysis used to model count data and contingency tables. Poisson regression assumes the response variable Y has a Poisson distribution, and assumes the logarithm of its expected value can be modeled by a linear combination of unknown parameters. A Poisson regression model is sometimes known as a log-linear model, especially when used to model contingency tables."
29082,poisson regression vs linear regression,50401,"Logistic regression is an alternative to Fisher's 1936 method, linear discriminant analysis.  If the assumptions of linear discriminant analysis hold, the conditioning can be reversed to produce logistic regression.  The converse is not true, however, because logistic regression does not require the multivariate normal assumption of discriminant analysis."
29082,poisson regression vs linear regression,50402,"Like other forms of regression analysis, logistic regression makes use of one or more predictor variables that may be either continuous or categorical. Unlike ordinary linear regression, however, logistic regression is used for predicting dependent variables that take membership in one of a limited number of categories (treating the dependent variable in the binomial case as the outcome of a Bernoulli trial) rather than a continuous outcome. Given this difference, the assumptions of linear regression are violated. In particular, the residuals cannot be normally distributed. In addition, linear regression may make nonsensical predictions for a binary dependent variable. What is needed is a way to convert a binary variable into a continuous one that can take on any real value (negative or positive). To do that, binomial logistic regression first calculates the odds of the event happening for different levels of each independent variable, and then takes its logarithm to create a continuous criterion as a transformed version of the dependent variable. The logarithm of the odds is the logit of the probability, the logit is defined as follows:"
29082,poisson regression vs linear regression,50403,"After fitting the model, it is likely that researchers will want to examine the contribution of individual predictors. To do so, they will want to examine the regression coefficients. In linear regression, the regression coefficients represent the change in the criterion for each unit change in the predictor. In logistic regression, however, the regression coefficients represent the change in the logit for each unit change in the predictor. Given that the logit is not intuitive, researchers are likely to focus on a predictor's effect on the exponential function of the regression coefficient – the odds ratio (see definition). In linear regression, the significance of a regression coefficient is assessed by computing a t test. In logistic regression, there are several different tests designed to assess the significance of an individual predictor, most notably the likelihood ratio test and the Wald statistic."
29082,poisson regression vs linear regression,50404,"But for now, using the algorithm you just learned, now we're using batch gradient descent, you now know how to implement gradient descent, or linear regression. So that's linear regression with gradient descent. If you've seen advanced linear algebra before so some you may have taken a class with advanced linear algebra, you might know that there exists a solution for numerically solving for the minimum of the cost function J, without needing to use and iterative algorithm like gradient descent. Later in this course we will talk about that method as well that just solves for the minimum cost function J without needing this multiple steps of gradient descent. That other method is called normal equations methods."
29082,poisson regression vs linear regression,50405,"For linear regression, we had previously worked out two learning algorithms, one based on gradient descent and one based on the normal equation. In this video we will take those two algorithms and generalize them to the case of regularized linear regression. Here's the optimization objective, that we came up with last time for regularized linear regression. This first part is our usual, objective for linear regression, and we now have this additional regularization term, where londer is our regularization parameter, and we like to find parameters theta, that minimizes this cost function, this regularized cost function, J of theta. Previously, we were using gradient descent for the original cost function, without the regularization term, and we had the following algorithm for regular linear regression, without regularization. We will repeatedly update the parameters theta J as follows for J equals 1,2 up through n. Let me take this and just write the case for theta zero separately."

In this video, we're going to put together gradient descent with our cost function, and that will give us an algorithm for linear regression for fitting a straight line to our data. So, this is what we worked out in the previous videos. That's our gradient descent algorithm, which should be familiar, and you see the linear linear regression model with our linear hypothesis and our squared error cost function. What we're going to do is apply gradient descent to minimize our squared error cost function. Now, in order to apply gradient descent, in order to write this piece of code, the key term we need is this derivative term over here."
29082,poisson regression vs linear regression,50408,"Logistic regression measures the relationship between the categorical dependent variable and one or more independent variables by estimating probabilities using a logistic function, which is the cumulative distribution function of logistic distribution. Thus, it treats the same set of problems as probit regression using similar techniques, with the latter using a cumulative normal distribution curve instead.  Equivalently, in the latent variable interpretations of these two methods, the first assumes a standard logistic distribution of errors and the second a standard normal distribution of errors.Logistic regression can be seen as a special case of the generalized linear model and thus analogous to linear regression. The model of logistic regression, however, is based on quite different assumptions (about the relationship between the dependent and independent variables) from those of linear regression. In particular, the key differences between these two models can be seen in the following two features of logistic regression. First, the conditional distribution "

And in Octave, if you implement this to compute theta, it turns out that this will actually do the right thing."

Multimodal sentiment analysis also plays an important role in the advancement of virtual assistants through the application of natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques. In the healthcare domain, multimodal sentiment analysis can be utilized to detect certain medical conditions such as stress, anxiety, or depression. Multimodal sentiment analysis can also be applied in understanding the sentiments contained in video news programs, which is considered as a complicated and challenging domain, as sentiments expressed by reporters tend to be less obvious or neutral."
29083,r text sentiment analysis,50411,"High-quality information is typically obtained by devising patterns and trends by means such as statistical pattern learning. According to Hotho et al. (2005) we can differ three different perspectives of text mining: information extraction, data mining, and a KDD (Knowledge Discovery in Databases) process. Text mining usually involves the process of structuring the input text (usually parsing, along with the addition of some derived linguistic features and the removal of others, and subsequent insertion into a database), deriving patterns within the structured data, and finally evaluation and interpretation of the output. 'High quality' in text mining usually refers to some combination of relevance, novelty, and interest. Typical text mining tasks include text categorization, text clustering, concept/entity extraction, production of granular taxonomies, sentiment analysis, document summarization, and entity relation modeling (i.e., learning relations between named entities)."

It can be bimodal, which includes different combinations of two modalities, or trimodal, which incorporates three modalities. With the extensive amount of social media data available online in different forms such as videos and images, the conventional text-based sentiment analysis has evolved into more complex models of multimodal sentiment analysis, which can be applied in the development of  virtual assistants, analysis of YouTube movie reviews, analysis of news videos, and emotion recognition (sometimes known as emotion detection) such as depression monitoring, among others."
29083,r text sentiment analysis,50413,"Until recently, websites most often used text-based searches, which only found documents containing specific user-defined words or phrases. Now, through use of a semantic web, text mining can find content based on meaning and context (rather than just by a specific word). Additionally, text mining software can be used to build large dossiers of information about specific people and events.  For example, large datasets based on data extracted from news reports can be built to facilitate social networks analysis or counter-intelligence.  In effect, the text mining software may act in a capacity similar to an intelligence analyst or research librarian, albeit with a more limited scope of analysis. Text mining is also used in some email spam filters as a way of determining the characteristics of messages that are likely to be advertisements or other unwanted material.

Scientific researchers incorporate text mining approaches into efforts to organize large sets of text data (i.e., addressing the problem of unstructured data), to determine ideas communicated through text (e.g., sentiment analysis in social media) and to support scientific discovery in fields such as the life sciences and bioinformatics.

29084,what is an ordinal variable,50423,"In 1946, Stevens observed that psychological measurement, such as measurement of opinions, usually operates on ordinal scales; thus means and standard deviations have no validity, but they can be used to get ideas for how to improve operationalization of variables used in questionnaires. Most psychological data collected by psychometric instruments and tests, measuring cognitive and other abilities, are ordinal, although some theoreticians have argued they can be treated as interval or ratio scales. However, there is little prima facie evidence to suggest that such attributes are anything more than ordinal (Cliff, 1996; Cliff & Keats, 2003; Michell, 2008). In particular, IQ scores reflect an ordinal scale, in which all scores are meaningful for comparison only.

Rank orders represent ordinal scales and are frequently used in research relating to qualitative phenomena. A student’s rank in his graduation class involves the use of an ordinal scale. One has to be very careful in making statement about scores based on ordinal scales. For instance, if Devi’s position in his class is 10 and Ganga's position is 40, it cannot be said that Devi’s position is four times as good as that of Ganga. The statement would make no sense at all."
29084,what is an ordinal variable,50428,"The ordinal type allows for rank order (1st, 2nd, 3rd, etc.) by which data can be sorted, but still does not allow for relative degree of difference between them. Examples include, on one hand, dichotomous data with dichotomous (or dichotomized) values such as 'sick' vs. 'healthy' when measuring health, 'guilty' vs. 'not-guilty' when making judgments in courts, 'wrong/false' vs. 'right/true' when measuring truth value, and, on the other hand, non-dichotomous data consisting of a spectrum of values, such as 'completely agree', 'mostly agree', 'mostly disagree', 'completely disagree' when measuring opinion."
29084,what is an ordinal variable,50429,"Ordinal scales only permit the ranking of items from highest to lowest. Ordinal measures have no absolute values, and the real differences between adjacent ranks may not be equal. All that can be said is that one person is higher or lower on the scale than another, but more precise comparisons cannot be made. Thus, the use of an ordinal scale implies a statement of ‘greater than’ or ‘less than’ (an equality statement is also acceptable) without our being able to state how much greater or less. The real difference between ranks 1 and 2 may be more or less than the difference between ranks 5 and 6. Since the numbers of this scale have only a rank meaning, the appropriate measure of central tendency is the median. A percentile or quartile measure is used for measuring dispersion. Correlations are restricted to various rank order methods. Measures of statistical significance are restricted to the non-parametric methods (R. M. Kothari, 2004)."

The Sinclair calculators were successful because they were far cheaper than the competition; however, their design led to slow and inaccurate computations of transcendental functions.Meanwhile, Hewlett-Packard (HP) had been developing a pocket calculator. Launched in early 1972, it was unlike the other basic four-function pocket calculators then available in that it was the first pocket calculator with scientific functions that could replace a slide rule. The $395 HP-35, along with nearly all later HP engineering calculators, used reverse Polish notation (RPN), also called postfix notation. A calculation like ""8 plus 5"" is, using RPN, performed by pressing 8, Enter↑, 5, and +; instead of the algebraic infix notation: 8, +, 5, =. It had 35 buttons and was based on Mostek Mk6020 chip."

Pascal's calculator could add and subtract two numbers directly and thus, if the tedium could be borne, multiply and divide by repetition. Schickard's machine, constructed several decades earlier, used a clever set of mechanised multiplication tables to ease the process of multiplication and division with the adding machine as a means of completing this operation. (Because they were different inventions with different aims a debate about whether Pascal or Schickard should be credited as the ""inventor"" of the adding machine (or calculating machine) is probably pointless.) Schickard and Pascal were followed by Gottfried Leibniz who spent forty years designing a four-operation mechanical calculator, the stepped reckoner, inventing in the process his leibniz wheel, but who couldn't design a fully operational machine. There were also five unsuccessful attempts to design a calculating clock in the 17th century."

The prototypical early stopping hyperparameter optimization algorithm is Successive Halving (SHA), which begins as a random search but periodically prunes low-performing models, thereby focusing computational resources on more promising models.  Asynchronous Successive Halving (ASHA) further improves upon SHA’s resource utilization profile by removing the need to synchronously evaluate and prune low-performing models. Hyperband is a higher level early stopping-based algorithm that invokes SHA or ASHA multiple times with varying levels of pruning aggressiveness, in order to be more widely applicable and with fewer required inputs."

Applied to hyperparameter optimization, Bayesian optimization builds a probabilistic model of the function mapping from hyperparameter values to the objective evaluated on a validation set. By iteratively evaluating a promising hyperparameter configuration based on the current model, and then updating it, Bayesian optimization, aims to gather observations revealing as much information as possible about this function and, in particular, the location of the optimum. It tries to balance exploration (hyperparameters for which the outcome is most uncertain) and exploitation (hyperparameters expected close to the optimum). In practice, Bayesian optimization has been shown to obtain better results in fewer evaluations compared to grid search and random search, due to the ability to reason about the quality of experiments before they are run."

For higher degrees the specific names are not commonly used, although quartic polynomial (for degree four) and quintic polynomial (for degree five) are sometimes used. The names for the degrees may be applied to the polynomial or to its terms. For example, in x2 + 2x + 1 the term 2x is a linear term in a quadratic polynomial."
29090,polynomial 4th degree,50483,"A polynomial in one indeterminate is called a univariate polynomial, a polynomial in more than one indeterminate is called a multivariate polynomial. A polynomial with two indeterminates is called a bivariate polynomial. These notions refer more to the kind of polynomials one is generally working with than to individual polynomials; for instance when working with univariate polynomials one does not exclude constant polynomials (which may result, for instance, from the subtraction of non-constant polynomials), although strictly speaking constant polynomials do not contain any indeterminates at all. It is possible to further classify multivariate polynomials as bivariate, trivariate, and so on, according to the maximum number of indeterminates allowed. Again, so that the set of objects under consideration be closed under subtraction, a study of trivariate polynomials usually allows bivariate polynomials, and so on. It is common, also, to say simply ""polynomials in x, y, and z"", listing the indeterminates allowed."

29090,polynomial 4th degree,50485,"The commutative law of addition can be used to rearrange terms into any preferred order. In polynomials with one indeterminate, the terms are usually ordered according to degree, either in ""descending powers of x"", with the term of largest degree first, or in ""ascending powers of x"". The polynomial in the example above is written in descending powers of x. The first term has coefficient 3, indeterminate x, and exponent 2. In the second term, the coefficient is −5. The third term is a constant. Because the degree of a non-zero polynomial is the largest degree of any one term, this polynomial has degree two.Two terms with the same indeterminates raised to the same powers are called ""similar terms"" or ""like terms"", and they can be combined, using the distributive law, into a single term whose coefficient is the sum of the coefficients of the terms that were combined. It may happen that this makes the coefficient 0. Polynomials can be classified by the number of terms with nonzero coefficients, so that a one-term polynomial is called a monomial, a two-term polynomial is called a binomial, and a three-term polynomial is called a trinomial. The term ""quadrinomial"" is occasionally used for a four-term polynomial."

George Lakoff offers a methodology to build Natural language processing (NLP) algorithms through the perspective of Cognitive science, along with the findings of Cognitive linguistics:The first defining aspect of this cognitive task of NLP is the application of the theory of Conceptual metaphor, explained by Lakoff as “the understanding of one idea, in terms of another” which provides an idea of the intent of the author.For example, consider some of the meanings, in English, of the word “big”. When used as a Comparative, as in “That is a big tree,” a likely inference of the intent of the author is that the author is using the word “big” to imply a statement about the tree being ”physically large” in comparison to other trees or the authors experience.  When used as a Stative verb, as in ”Tomorrow is a big day”, a likely inference of the author’s intent it that ”big” is being used to imply ”importance”.  These examples are not presented to be complete, but merely as indicators of the implication of the idea of Conceptual metaphor.  The intent behind other usages, like in ”She is a big person” will remain somewhat ambiguous to a person and a cognitive NLP algorithm alike without additional information."
29093,natural language processing examples,50514,"In this chapter we talked about the basics of processing text, also known as natural language processing (NLP), with an example application classifying movie reviews. The tools discussed here should serve as a great starting point when trying to process text data. In particular for text classification tasks such as spam and fraud detection or sentiment analysis, bag-of-words representations provide a simple and powerful solution. As is often the case in machine learning, the representation of the data is key in NLP applications, and inspecting the tokens and n-grams that are extracted can give powerful insights into the modeling process. In text-processing applications, it is often possible to introspect models in a meaningful way, as we saw in this chapter, for both supervised and unsupervised tasks. You should take full advantage of this ability when using NLP-based methods in practice."

Subsequently, breast cancer medical examples have been utilized to predict whether the cancer is malignant or benign using KNN.

29093,natural language processing examples,50518,"Throughout the years various attempts at processing natural language or English-like sentences presented to computers have taken place at varying degrees of complexity. Some attempts have not resulted in systems with deep understanding, but have helped overall system usability. For example, Wayne Ratliff originally developed the Vulcan program with an English-like syntax to mimic the English speaking computer in Star Trek. Vulcan later became the dBase system whose easy-to-use syntax effectively launched the personal computer database industry. Systems with an easy to use or English like syntax are, however, quite distinct from systems that use a rich lexicon and include an internal representation (often as first order logic) of the semantics of natural language sentences."
29093,natural language processing examples,50519,"In the 2010s, representation learning and deep neural network-style machine learning methods became widespread in natural language processing, due in part to a flurry of results showing that such techniques can achieve state-of-the-art results in many natural language tasks, for example in language modeling, parsing, and many others."
29094,linear algebra practice problem,50520,"who are experts in linear algebra, by redundant features, what I mean is the formal term is features that are linearly dependent. But in practice what that really means is one of these problems tripping up the algorithm if you just make you features non-redundant., that should solve the problem of sigma being non-invertable. But once again the odds of your running into this at all are pretty low so chances are, you can just apply the multivariate Gaussian model, without having to worry about sigma being non-invertible, so long as m is greater than or equal to n. So that's it for anomaly detection, with the multivariate Gaussian distribution. And if you apply this method you would be able to have an anomaly detection algorithm that automatically captures positive and negative correlations between your different features and flags an anomaly if it sees is unusual combination of the values of the features."

29094,linear algebra practice problem,50524,"After Grassmann, developments in multilinear algebra were made in 1872 by Victor Schlegel when he published the first part of his System der Raumlehre, and by Elwin Bruno Christoffel. A major advance in multilinear algebra came in the work of Gregorio Ricci-Curbastro and Tullio Levi-Civita (see references). It was the absolute differential calculus form of multilinear algebra that Marcel Grossmann and Michele Besso introduced to Albert Einstein. The publication in 1915 by Einstein of a general relativity explanation for the precession of the perihelion of Mercury, established multilinear algebra and tensors as physically important mathematics."
29094,linear algebra practice problem,50525,"In mathematics, multilinear algebra extends the methods of linear algebra. Just as linear algebra is built on the concept of a vector and develops the theory of vector spaces, multilinear algebra builds on the concepts of p-vectors and multivectors with Grassmann algebra."
29094,linear algebra practice problem,50526,"Indeed, what was done is almost precisely to explain that tensor spaces are the constructions required to reduce multilinear problems to linear problems. This purely algebraic attack conveys no geometric intuition."
29094,linear algebra practice problem,50527,"Around the middle of the 20th century the study of tensors was reformulated more abstractly. The Bourbaki group's treatise Multilinear Algebra was especially influential—in fact the term multilinear algebra was probably coined there.One reason at the time was a new area of application, homological algebra. The development of algebraic topology during the 1940s gave additional incentive for the development of a purely algebraic treatment of the tensor product. The computation of the homology groups of the product of two topological spaces involves the tensor product; but only in the simplest cases, such as a torus, is it directly calculated in that fashion (see Künneth theorem). The topological phenomena were subtle enough to need better foundational concepts; technically speaking, the Tor functors had to be defined."
29094,linear algebra practice problem,50528,"In a vector space of dimension n, one usually considers only the vectors. According to Hermann Grassmann and others, this presumption misses the complexity of considering the structures of pairs, triples, and general multivectors. Since there are several combinatorial possibilities, the space of multivectors turns out to have 2n dimensions. The abstract formulation of the determinant is the most immediate application.  Multilinear algebra also has applications in mechanical study of material response to stress and strain with various moduli of elasticity. This practical reference led to the use of the word tensor to describe the elements of the multilinear space. The extra structure in a multilinear space has led it to play an important role in various studies in higher mathematics. Though Grassmann started the subject in 1844 with his Ausdehnungslehre, and republished in 1862, his work was slow to find acceptance as ordinary linear algebra provided sufficient challenges to comprehension."
29094,linear algebra practice problem,50529,The subject matter of multilinear algebra has evolved less than the presentation down the years. Here are further pages centrally relevant to it:
29095,job evaluation techniques,50530,"Behavioral Checklists and Scales: behaviors are more definite than traits.  The critical incidents method (or critical incident technique) concerns ""specific behaviors indicative of good or bad job performance"".  Supervisors record behaviors of what they judge to be job performance relevant, and they keep a running tally of good and bad behaviors.  A discussion on performance may then follow.  The behaviorally anchored rating scales (BARS) combine the critical incidents method with rating scale methods by rating performance on a scale but with the scale points being anchored by behavioral incidents.  Note that BARS are job specific. In the behavioral observation scale (BOS) approach to performance appraisal, employees are also evaluated in the terms of critical incidents. In that respect, it is similar to BARS. However, the BOS appraisal rate subordinates on the frequency of the critical incidents as they are observed to occur over a given period. The ratings are assigned on a five-point scale. The behavioral incidents for the rating scale are developed in the same way as for BARS through identification by supervisors or other subject matter experts. Similarly, BOS techniques meet equal employment opportunity because they are related to actual behavior required for successful job performance."
29095,job evaluation techniques,50531,"What is job design? As we just explained, job analysis provides job-related data as well as the skills and knowledge required for the incumbent to perform the job. A better job performance also requires deciding on sequence of job contents. This is called 'job design'. Job design is a logical sequence to job analysis. In other words, job design involves specifying the contents of a job, the work methods used in its performance and how the job relates to other jobs in the organisation."
29095,job evaluation techniques,50532,"Job enlargement expands a job horizontally. It increases job scope; that is, it increases the number of different operations required in a job and the frequency with which the job cycle is repeated. By increasing the number of tasks an individual performs, job enlargement increases the job scope, or job diversity. Instead of only sorting the incoming mail by department, for instance, a mail sorter's job could be enlarged to include physically delivering the mail to the various departments or running outgoing letters through the postage meter."
29095,job evaluation techniques,50533,"Having gone through the above definitions of job design, it can now be described as a deliberate attempt made to structure both technical and social aspects of the job to attain a fit between the individual (job holder) and the job. The very idea is that job should be designed in such a way as to enable employees to control over the aspects of their work. The underlying justification being that by doing this, it enhances the quality of the work life, harnesses the potential of the workers in a more effective manner and thereby improves employee performance."
29095,job evaluation techniques,50534,"Basically, there are four techniques used in the design of jobs. These include Job simplification, Job enlargement, Job enrichment and Job rotation."
29095,job evaluation techniques,50535,"Job rotation refers to the movement of an employee from one job to another. Jobs themselves are not actually changed, only the employees are rotated among various jobs. An employee who works on a routine job moves to work on another job for some hours/days/months and returns to the first job. This measure relieves the employee from the boredom and monotony, improves the employee's skills regarding various jobs and prepares worker's self-image and provides personal growth. However, frequent job rotations are not advisable in view of their negative impact on the organisation and the employee.."
29095,job evaluation techniques,50536,"Michael Armstrong11 has defined job design as ""the process of deciding on the contents of a job in terms of its duties and responsibilities, on the methods to be used in carrying out the job, in terms of techniques, systems and procedures, and on the relationships that should exist between the job holder and his superiors, subordinates and colleagues""."

Hence, the P-value for a righttailed test for F = 3.58 falls between 0.025 and 0.05 (that is, 0.025 < P-value < 0.05). For a right-tailed test, then, you would reject the null hypothesis at α = 0.05, but not at α = 0.01. The P-value obtained from a calculator is 0.0408."
29096,t test calculator p value,50542,"The p-value is widely used in statistical hypothesis testing, specifically in null hypothesis significance testing. In this method, as part of experimental design, before performing the experiment, one first chooses a model (the null hypothesis) and a threshold value for p, called the significance level of the test, traditionally 5% or 1% and denoted as α. If the p-value is less than the chosen significance level (α), that suggests that the observed data is sufficiently inconsistent with the null hypothesis and that the null hypothesis may be rejected. However, that does not prove that the tested hypothesis is true. When the p-value is calculated correctly, this test guarantees that the type I error rate is at most α. For typical analysis, using the standard α = 0.05 cutoff, the null hypothesis is rejected when p < .05 and not rejected when p > .05. The p-value does not, in itself, support reasoning about the probabilities of hypotheses but is only a tool for deciding whether to reject the null hypothesis."
29096,t test calculator p value,50543,"  This probability is the p-value, considering only extreme results that favor heads. This is called a one-tailed test. However, one might be interested in deviations in either direction, favoring either heads or tails. The two-tailed p-value, which considers deviations favoring either heads or tails, may instead be calculated. As the binomial distribution is symmetrical for a fair coin, the two-sided p-value is simply twice the above calculated single-sided p-value: the two-sided p-value is 0.115."
29096,t test calculator p value,50544,"The p-value was first formally introduced by Karl Pearson, in his Pearson's chi-squared test, using the chi-squared distribution and notated as capital P.

29096,t test calculator p value,50545,"The P-values for the t test can be found by using Table F; however, specific P-values for t tests cannot be obtained from the table since only selected values of α (for example, 0.01, 0.05) are given. To find specific P-values for t tests, you would need a table similar to Table E for each degree of freedom. Since this is not practical, only intervals can be found for P-values. Examples 8 –14 to 8 –16 show how to use Table F to determine intervals for P-values for the t test."

The team released version 1 to a small number of users in June 1989, followed by version 2 with a re-written rules system in June 1990. Version 3, released in 1991, again re-wrote the rules system, and added support for multiple storage managers and an improved query engine. By 1993, the number of users began to overwhelm the project with requests for support and features. After releasing version 4.2 on June 30, 1994 –  primarily a cleanup –  the project ended.

29100,what are not polynomial functions,50582,"If R is commutative, then one can associate to every polynomial P in R[x], a polynomial function f with domain and range equal to R (more generally one can take domain and range to be the same unital associative algebra over R). One obtains the value f(r) by substitution of the value r for the symbol x in P. One reason to distinguish between polynomials and polynomial functions is that over some rings different polynomials may give rise to the same polynomial function (see Fermat's little theorem for an example where R is the integers modulo p). This is not the case when R is the real or complex numbers, whence the two concepts are not always distinguished in analysis. An even more important reason to distinguish between polynomials and polynomial functions is that many operations on polynomials (like Euclidean division) require looking at what a polynomial is composed of as an expression rather than evaluating it at some constant value for x."
29100,what are not polynomial functions,50583,"The simple structure of polynomial functions makes them quite useful in analyzing general functions using polynomial approximations. An important example in calculus is Taylor's theorem, which roughly states that every differentiable function locally looks like a polynomial function, and the Stone–Weierstrass theorem, which states that every continuous function defined on a compact interval of the real axis can be approximated on the whole interval as closely as desired by a polynomial function.

Let's look at the training error and cause-validation error and plot them on this figure. Let's start with the training error. As we increase the degree of the polynomial, we're going to fit our training set better and better and so, if d equals 1 that ever rose to the high training error. If we have a very high degree of polynomial, our training error is going to be really low."
29101,natural language processing example,50591,"In this chapter we talked about the basics of processing text, also known as natural language processing (NLP), with an example application classifying movie reviews. The tools discussed here should serve as a great starting point when trying to process text data. In particular for text classification tasks such as spam and fraud detection or sentiment analysis, bag-of-words representations provide a simple and powerful solution. As is often the case in machine learning, the representation of the data is key in NLP applications, and inspecting the tokens and n-grams that are extracted can give powerful insights into the modeling process. In text-processing applications, it is often possible to introspect models in a meaningful way, as we saw in this chapter, for both supervised and unsupervised tasks. You should take full advantage of this ability when using NLP-based methods in practice."

29101,natural language processing example,50594,"Cognition refers to ""the mental action or process of acquiring knowledge and understanding through thought, experience, and the senses."" Cognitive science is the interdisciplinary, scientific study of the mind and its processes. Cognitive linguistics is an interdisciplinary branch of linguistics, combining knowledge and research from both psychology and linguistics.  George Lakoff offers a methodology to build Natural language processing (NLP) algorithms through the perspective of Cognitive science, along with the findings of Cognitive linguistics:The first defining aspect of this cognitive task of NLP is the application of the theory of Conceptual metaphor, explained by Lakoff as “the understanding of one idea, in terms of another” which provides an idea of the intent of the author.For example, consider some of the meanings, in English, of the word “big”. When used as a Comparative, as in “That is a big tree,” a likely inference of the intent of the author is that the author is using the word “big” to imply a statement about the tree being ”physically large” in comparison to other trees or the authors experience.  When used as a Stative verb, as in ”Tomorrow is a big day”, a likely inference of the author’s intent it that ”big” is being used to imply ”importance”.  These examples are not presented to be complete, but merely as indicators of the implication of the idea of Conceptual metaphor.  The intent behind other usages, like in ”She is a big person” will remain somewhat ambiguous to a person and a cognitive NLP algorithm alike without additional information."
29101,natural language processing example,50595,"Throughout the years various attempts at processing natural language or English-like sentences presented to computers have taken place at varying degrees of complexity. Some attempts have not resulted in systems with deep understanding, but have helped overall system usability. For example, Wayne Ratliff originally developed the Vulcan program with an English-like syntax to mimic the English speaking computer in Star Trek. Vulcan later became the dBase system whose easy-to-use syntax effectively launched the personal computer database industry. Systems with an easy to use or English like syntax are, however, quite distinct from systems that use a rich lexicon and include an internal representation (often as first order logic) of the semantics of natural language sentences."
29101,natural language processing example,50596,"In the 2010s, representation learning and deep neural network-style machine learning methods became widespread in natural language processing, due in part to a flurry of results showing that such techniques can achieve state-of-the-art results in many natural language tasks, for example in language modeling, parsing, and many others."
29101,natural language processing example,50597,"Another important advantage of CRFs is that we can make the potentials (or factors) of the model be data-dependent. For example, in image processing applications, we may “turn off” the label smoothing between two neighboring nodes s and t if there is an observed discontinuity in the image intensity between pixels s and t. Similarly, in natural language processing problems, we can make the latent labels depend on global properties of the sentence, such as which language it is written in. It is hard to incorporate global features into generative models."
29101,natural language processing example,50598,"I'll talk more about this specific concepts in later videos, but here's a specific example. Let's say we are trying to decide whether or not we should treat words like discount, discounts, discounter, discounting, as the same word. So maybe one way to do that is to just look at the first few characters in a word. Like, you know, if you just look at the first few characters of a word, then you figure out that maybe all of these words are roughly - have similar meanings. In natural language processing, the way that this is done is actually using a type of software called stemming software. If you ever want to do this yourself, search on a web search engine for the Porter Stemmer and that would be, you know, one reasonable piece of software for doing this sort of stemming, which will let you treat all of these discount, discounts, and so on as the same word."
29101,natural language processing example,50599,"example, we can combine a grid structured graph with local submodular factors to perform image segmentation, together with a tree structured model to perform pose estimation (see Exercise 22.4).

29102,cluster photo sharing,50600,"How “bad” does a cluster need to be to be labeled abusive? This is mostly signifi‐ cant for the supervised case, in which your algorithm will learn about clusters as a whole. In some cases, a single bad entity in a cluster is enough to “taint” the entire cluster. One example is profile photos on a social network; nearly any account sharing a photo with a bad account will also be bad."
29102,cluster photo sharing,50601,"Connectivity-based clustering, also known as hierarchical clustering, is based on the core idea of objects being more related to nearby objects than to objects farther away. These algorithms connect ""objects"" to form ""clusters"" based on their distance. A cluster can be described largely by the maximum distance needed to connect parts of the cluster. At different distances, different clusters will form, which can be represented using a dendrogram, which explains where the common name ""hierarchical clustering"" comes from: these algorithms do not provide a single partitioning of the data set, but instead provide an extensive hierarchy of clusters that merge with each other at certain distances. In a dendrogram, the y-axis marks the distance at which the clusters merge, while the objects are placed along the x-axis such that the clusters don't mix."
29102,cluster photo sharing,50602,"where d(i,j) represents the distance between clusters i and j, and d '(k) measures the intra-cluster distance of cluster k. The inter-cluster distance d(i,j) between two clusters may be any number of distance measures, such as the distance between the centroids of the clusters. Similarly, the intra-cluster distance d '(k) may be measured in a variety ways, such as the maximal distance between any pair of elements in cluster k. Since internal criterion seek clusters with high intra-cluster similarity and low inter-cluster similarity, algorithms that produce clusters with high Dunn index are more desirable.Silhouette coefficientThe silhouette coefficient contrasts the average distance to elements in the same cluster with the average distance to elements in other clusters. Objects with a high silhouette value are considered well clustered, objects with a low value may be outliers. This index works well with k-means clustering, and is also used to determine the optimal number of clusters."
29102,cluster photo sharing,50603,"Connectivity-based clustering is a whole family of methods that differ by the way distances are computed. Apart from the usual choice of distance functions, the user also needs to decide on the linkage criterion (since a cluster consists of multiple objects, there are multiple candidates to compute the distance) to use. Popular choices are known as single-linkage clustering (the minimum of object distances), complete linkage clustering (the maximum of object distances), and UPGMA or WPGMA (""Unweighted or Weighted Pair Group Method with Arithmetic Mean"", also known as average linkage clustering). Furthermore, hierarchical clustering can be agglomerative (starting with single elements and aggregating them into clusters) or divisive (starting with the complete data set and dividing it into partitions)."
29102,cluster photo sharing,50604,"The notion of a ""cluster"" cannot be precisely defined, which is one of the reasons why there are so many clustering algorithms. There is a common denominator: a group of data objects. However, different researchers employ different cluster models, and for each of these cluster models again different algorithms can be given. The notion of a cluster, as found by different algorithms, varies significantly in its properties. Understanding these ""cluster models"" is key to understanding the differences between the various algorithms. Typical cluster models include:"
29102,cluster photo sharing,50605,"How large does a cluster need to be to be significant? Most legitimate activity, and some fraudulent activity, will not be coordinated, so you will need to remove data that doesn’t cluster into a large enough group."
29102,cluster photo sharing,50606,"These methods will not produce a unique partitioning of the data set, but a hierarchy from which the user still needs to choose appropriate clusters. They are not very robust towards outliers, which will either show up as additional clusters or even cause other clusters to merge (known as ""chaining phenomenon"", in particular with single-linkage clustering). In the general case, the complexity is "
29102,cluster photo sharing,50607,"The most popular density based clustering method is DBSCAN. In contrast to many newer methods, it features a well-defined cluster model called ""density-reachability"". Similar to linkage based clustering, it is based on connecting points within certain distance thresholds. However, it only connects points that satisfy a density criterion, in the original variant defined as a minimum number of other objects within this radius. A cluster consists of all density-connected objects (which can form a cluster of an arbitrary shape, in contrast to many other methods) plus all objects that are within these objects' range. Another interesting property of DBSCAN is that its complexity is fairly low – it requires a linear number of range queries on the database – and that it will discover essentially the same results (it is deterministic for core and noise points, but not for border points) in each run, therefore there is no need to run it multiple times. OPTICS is a generalization of DBSCAN that removes the need to choose an appropriate value for the range parameter "
29102,cluster photo sharing,50608,"The algorithmic approach to implementing this intuition is clustering: identifying groups of entities that are similar to one another in some mathematical sense. But merely separating your accounts or events into groups is not sufficient for fraud detection—you also need to determine whether each cluster is legitimate or abusive. Finally, you should examine the abusive clusters for false positives—accounts that accidentally were caught in your net."
29102,cluster photo sharing,50609,"In centroid-based clustering, clusters are represented by a central vector, which may not necessarily be a member of the data set. When the number of clusters is fixed to k, k-means clustering gives a formal definition as an optimization problem: find the k cluster centers and assign the objects to the nearest cluster center, such that the squared distances from the cluster are minimized."

New players start at 2100, with top players rating over 3000. In Guild Wars, Elo ratings are used to record guild rating gained and lost through guild versus guild battles, which are two-team fights. The initial K-value was 30, but was changed to 5 in January 2007, then changed to 15 in July 2009. World of Warcraft formerly used the Elo rating system when teaming up and comparing Arena players, but now uses a system similar to Microsoft's TrueSkill. The MOBA game League of Legends used an Elo rating system prior to the second season of competitive play. The game Puzzle Pirates uses the Elo rating system to determine the standings in the various puzzles. Roblox introduced the Elo rating in 2010. The browser game Quidditch Manager uses the Elo rating to measure a team's performance. Another recent game to start using the Elo rating system is AirMech, using Elo ratings for 1v1, 2v2, and 3v3 random/team matchmaking. RuneScape 3 was to use the Elo system for the rerelease of bounty hunter in 2016. Mechwarrior Online instituted an Elo system for its new ""Comp Queue"" mode, effective with the Jun 20, 2017 patch.In 1998 an online gaming ladder called Clanbase was launched, who used the Elo scoring system to rank teams.

Conversely, there are other movies that were not liked by those who rated it immediately, but were better appreciated after a while; “Memento” was cited as an example. While one cannot tease out of the data information about how long was the delay between viewing and rating, it is generally safe to assume that most people see a movie shortly after it comes out.

The gaps in these Elo ratings translate into predictions that AlphaGo Zero would defeat these other programs with probabilities very close to one. In a match of 100 games between AlphaGo Zero, trained as described, and the exact version of AlphaGo that defeated Lee Sedol held under the same conditions that were used in that match, AlphaGo Zero defeated AlphaGo in all 100 games."

In Spark 1.x, the RDD was the primary application programming interface (API), but as of Spark 2.x use of the Dataset API is encouraged even though the RDD API is not deprecated. The RDD technology still underlies the Dataset API.Spark and its RDDs were developed in 2012 in response to limitations in the MapReduce cluster computing paradigm, which forces a particular linear dataflow structure on distributed programs: MapReduce programs read input data from disk, map a function across the data, reduce the results of the map, and store reduction results on disk. Spark's RDDs function as a working set for distributed programs that offers a (deliberately) restricted form of distributed shared memory.Spark facilitates the implementation of both iterative algorithms, which visit their data set multiple times in a loop, and interactive/exploratory data analysis, i.e., the repeated database-style querying of data.

This interface mirrors a functional/higher-order model of programming: a ""driver"" program invokes parallel operations such as map, filter or reduce on an RDD by passing a function to Spark, which then schedules the function's execution in parallel on the cluster. These operations, and additional ones such as joins, take RDDs as input and produce new RDDs. RDDs are immutable and their operations are lazy; fault-tolerance is achieved by keeping track of the ""lineage"" of each RDD (the sequence of operations that produced it) so that it can be reconstructed in the case of data loss.

So, now that you have learned these feature vectors, this gives us a very convenient way to measure how similar two movies are. In particular, movie i has a feature vector xi. and so if you can find a different movie, j, so that the distance between xi and xj is small, then this is a pretty strong indication that, you know, movies j and i are somehow similar. At least in the sense that some of them likes movie i, maybe more likely to like movie j as well."
29106,artificial intelligence description,50640,"The earliest instance of which we are aware in which reinforcement learning was discussed using the MDP formalism is Andreae’s (1969b) description of a unified view of learning machines. Witten and Corbin (1973) experimented with a reinforcement learning system later analyzed by Witten (1977) using the MDP formalism. Although he did not explicitly mention MDPs, Werbos (1977) suggested approximate solution methods for stochastic optimal control problems that are related to modern reinforcement learning methods (see also Werbos, 1982, 1987, 1988, 1989, 1992). Although Werbos’s ideas were not widely recognized at the time, they were prescient in emphasizing the importance of approximately solving optimal control problems in a variety of domains, including artificial intelligence. The most influential integration of reinforcement learning and MDPs is due to Watkins (1989)."
29106,artificial intelligence description,50641,"In the late 1980s, several researchers advocated a completely new approach to artificial intelligence, based on robotics. They believed that, to show real intelligence, a machine needs to have a body — it needs to perceive, move, survive and deal with the world. They argued that these sensorimotor skills are essential to higher level skills like commonsense reasoning and that abstract reasoning was actually the least interesting or important human skill (see Moravec's paradox). They advocated building intelligence ""from the bottom up.""The approach revived ideas from cybernetics and control theory that had been unpopular since the sixties. Another precursor was David Marr, who had come to MIT in the late 1970s from a successful background in theoretical neuroscience to lead the group studying vision. He rejected all symbolic approaches (both McCarthy's logic and Minsky's frames), arguing that AI needed to understand the physical machinery of vision from the bottom up before any symbolic processing took place. (Marr's work would be cut short by leukemia in 1980.)In a 1990 paper, ""Elephants Don't Play Chess,"" robotics researcher Rodney Brooks took direct aim at the physical symbol system hypothesis, arguing that symbols are not always necessary since ""the world is its own best model. It is always exactly up to date. It always has every detail there is to be known. The trick is to sense it appropriately and often enough."" In the 1980s and 1990s, many cognitive scientists also rejected the symbol processing model of the mind and argued that the body was essential for reasoning, a theory called the embodied mind thesis."
29106,artificial intelligence description,50642,"The history of Artificial Intelligence (AI) began in antiquity, with myths, stories and rumors of artificial beings endowed with intelligence or consciousness by master craftsmen. The seeds of modern AI were planted by classical philosophers who attempted to describe the process of human thinking as the mechanical manipulation of symbols. This work culminated in the invention of the programmable digital computer in the 1940s, a machine based on the abstract essence of mathematical reasoning. This device and the ideas behind it inspired a handful of scientists to begin seriously discussing the possibility of building an electronic brain."

29106,artificial intelligence description,50644,"An intelligent agent is a system that perceives its environment and takes actions which maximize its chances of success. By this definition, simple programs that solve specific problems are ""intelligent agents"", as are human beings and organizations of human beings, such as firms. The intelligent agent paradigm defines AI research as ""the study of intelligent agents"". This is a generalization of some earlier definitions of AI: it goes beyond studying human intelligence; it studies all kinds of intelligence.The paradigm gave researchers license to study isolated problems and find solutions that were both verifiable and useful. It provided a common language to describe problems and share their solutions with each other, and with other fields that also used concepts of abstract agents, like economics and control theory. It was hoped that a complete agent architecture (like Newell's SOAR) would one day allow researchers to build more versatile and intelligent systems out of interacting intelligent agents."

Both formulations have been successful, but the successes have been of a different character."
29109,significance level calculator in statistics,50671,"Hypothesis testing provides a means of finding test statistics used in significance testing. The concept of power is useful in explaining the consequences of adjusting the significance level and is heavily used in sample size determination. The two methods remain philosophically distinct. They usually (but not always) produce the same mathematical answer. The preferred answer is context dependent. While the existing merger of Fisher and Neyman–Pearson theories has been heavily criticized, modifying the merger to achieve Bayesian goals has been considered."
29109,significance level calculator in statistics,50672,"The dispute over formulations is unresolved. Science primarily uses Fisher's (slightly modified) formulation as taught in introductory statistics. Statisticians study Neyman–Pearson theory in graduate school.

For the same reason, the confidence level is not the same as the complementary probability of the level of significance."
29109,significance level calculator in statistics,50675,The terminology is inconsistent. Hypothesis testing can mean any mixture of two formulations that both changed with time. Any discussion of significance testing vs hypothesis testing is doubly vulnerable to confusion.
29109,significance level calculator in statistics,50676,Neyman–Pearson theory can accommodate both prior probabilities and the costs of actions resulting from decisions. The former allows each test to consider the results of earlier tests (unlike Fisher's significance tests). The latter allows the consideration of economic issues (for example) as well as probabilities. A likelihood ratio remains a good criterion for selecting among hypotheses.
29109,significance level calculator in statistics,50677,"It may be convenient to make the general correspondence that parameter values within a confidence interval are equivalent to those values that would not be rejected by a hypothesis test, but this would be dangerous. In many instances the confidence intervals that are quoted are only approximately valid, perhaps derived from ""plus or minus twice the standard error,"" and the implications of this for the supposedly corresponding hypothesis tests are usually unknown."
29109,significance level calculator in statistics,50678,"The two forms of hypothesis testing are based on different problem formulations. The original test is analogous to a true/false question; the Neyman–Pearson test is more like multiple choice. In the view of Tukey the former produces a conclusion on the basis of only strong evidence while the latter produces a decision on the basis of available evidence. While the two tests seem quite different both mathematically and philosophically, later developments lead to the opposite claim. Consider many tiny radioactive sources. The hypotheses become 0,1,2,3... grains of radioactive sand. There is little distinction between none or some radiation (Fisher) and 0 grains of radioactive sand versus all of the alternatives (Neyman–Pearson). The major Neyman–Pearson paper of 1933 also considered composite hypotheses (ones whose distribution includes an unknown parameter). An example proved the optimality of the (Student's) t-test, ""there can be no better test for the hypothesis under consideration"" (p 321). Neyman–Pearson theory was proving the optimality of Fisherian methods from its inception."
29109,significance level calculator in statistics,50679,"An example of Neyman–Pearson hypothesis testing can be made by a change to the radioactive suitcase example. If the ""suitcase"" is actually a shielded container for the transportation of radioactive material, then a test might be used to select among three hypotheses: no radioactive source present, one present, two (all) present. The test could be required for safety, with actions required in each case. The Neyman–Pearson lemma of hypothesis testing says that a good criterion for the selection of hypotheses is the ratio of their probabilities (a likelihood ratio). A simple method of solution is to select the hypothesis with the highest probability for the Geiger counts observed. The typical result matches intuition: few counts imply no source, many counts imply two sources and intermediate counts imply one source. Notice also that usually there are problems for proving a negative. Null hypotheses should be at least falsifiable."

Different types of houses in different neighborhoods will have vastly different prices, but the price of a particular type of house in a particular neighborhood (e.g., three-bedroom house in moderately upscale neighborhood) will tend to cluster fairly closely around the mean.  One possible model of such prices would be to assume that the prices are accurately described by a mixture model with K different components, each distributed as a normal distribution with unknown mean and variance, with each component specifying a particular combination of house type/neighborhood.  Fitting this model to observed prices, e.g., using the expectation-maximization algorithm, would tend to cluster the prices according to house type/neighborhood and reveal the spread of prices in each type/neighborhood. (Note that for values such as prices or incomes that are guaranteed to be positive and which tend to grow exponentially, a log-normal distribution might actually be a better model than a normal distribution.)"

29111,normal mixture model,50693,"In an indirect application of the mixture model we do not assume such a mechanism. The mixture model is simply used for its mathematical flexibilities. For example, a mixture of two normal distributions with different means may result in a density with two modes, which is not modeled by standard parametric distributions. Another example is given by the possibility of mixture distributions to model fatter tails than the basic Gaussian ones, so as to be a candidate for modeling more extreme events. When combined with dynamical consistency, this approach has been applied to financial derivatives valuation in presence of the volatility smile in the context of local volatility models. This defines our application."

The motivation for this work was provided by the zoologist Walter Frank Raphael Weldon who had speculated in 1893 (in Tarter and Lock) that asymmetry in the histogram of these ratios could signal evolutionary divergence. Pearson's approach was to fit a univariate mixture of two normals to the data by choosing the five parameters of the mixture such that the empirical moments matched that of the model."

This decision boundary comes very close to the training examples. Let's see why the support vector machine will not do this. For this choice of parameters it's possible to show that the parameter vector theta is actually at 90 degrees to the decision boundary. And so, that green decision boundary corresponds to a parameter vector theta that points in that direction. And by the way, the simplification that theta 0 equals 0 that just means that the decision boundary must pass through the origin, (0,0) over there. So now, let's look at what this implies for the optimization objective. Let's say that this example here.

A definition of the sample complexity of exploration for a reinforcement learning algorithm is the number of time steps in which the algorithm does not select near-optimal actions (Kakade, 2003).

Furthermore, if we define a sequence of problems in which Hn = n, then the exhaustive search is still considered to be efficient.

All the best-known algorithms for NP-complete problems like 3SAT etc. take exponential time. Indeed, it is conjectured for many natural NP-complete problems that they do not have sub-exponential time algorithms. Here ""sub-exponential time"" is taken to mean the second definition presented below. (On the other hand, many graph problems represented in the natural way by adjacency matrices are solvable in subexponential time simply because the size of the input is square of the number of vertices.) This conjecture (for the k-SAT problem) is known as the exponential time hypothesis. Since it is conjectured that NP-complete problems do not have quasi-polynomial time algorithms, some inapproximability results in the field of approximation algorithms make the assumption that NP-complete problems do not have quasi-polynomial time algorithms.

29116,stimulus generalization meaning,50741,An argument from the poverty of the stimulus generally takes the following structure:
29116,stimulus generalization meaning,50742,"Poverty of the stimulus (POS) is the controversial argument from linguistics that children are not exposed to rich enough data within their linguistic environments to acquire every feature of their language. This is considered evidence contrary to the empiricist idea that language is learned solely through experience. The claim is that the sentences children hear while learning a language do not contain the information needed to develop a thorough understanding of the grammar of the language.The POS is often used as evidence for universal grammar. This is the idea that all languages conform to the same structural principles, which define the space of possible languages. Both poverty of the stimulus and universal grammar are terms that can be credited to Noam Chomsky, the main proponent of generative grammar. Chomsky coined the term ""poverty of the stimulus"" in 1980. However, he had argued for the idea since his 1959 review of B.F. Skinner's Verbal Behavior."
29116,stimulus generalization meaning,50743,"Linguistic nativism is the theory that humans are born with some knowledge of language. One acquires a language not entirely through experience. According to Noam Chomsky, ""The speed and precision of vocabulary acquisition leaves no real alternative to the conclusion that the child somehow has the concepts available before experience with language and is basically learning labels for concepts that are already a part of his or her conceptual apparatus."" One of the most significant arguments generative grammarians have for linguistic nativism is the poverty of the stimulus argument.Pullum and Scholz frame the poverty of the stimulus argument by examining all of the ways that the input is insufficient for language acquisition. First, children are exposed only to positive evidence. They do not receive explicit correction or instruction about what is not possible in the language. Second, the input that children receive is degenerate in terms of scope and quality. Degeneracy of scope means that the input does not contain information about the full extent of any grammatical rules. Degeneracy of quality means that children are exposed to speech errors, utterances by nonnative speakers, and false starts, potentially obscuring the grammatical structure of the language. Furthermore, the linguistic data each child is exposed to is different and so the basis for learning is idiosyncratic. However, despite these insufficiencies, children eventually acquire the grammar of the language they are exposed to.  Further, other organisms in the same environment do not.  From the nativists' point of view, the insufficiency of the input leads to the conclusion that humans are hard-wired with a UG and thus support the innateness hypothesis."
29116,stimulus generalization meaning,50744,"Chomsky coined the term ""poverty of the stimulus"" in 1980. This idea is closely related to what Chomsky calls ""Plato's Problem"". He outlined this philosophical approach in the first chapter of the Knowledge of Language in 1986. Plato's Problem traces back to Meno, a Socratic dialogue. In Meno, Socrates unearths knowledge of geometry concepts from a servant who was never explicitly taught them. Plato's Problem directly parallels the idea of the innateness of language, universal grammar, and more specifically the poverty of the stimulus argument because it reveals that people's knowledge is richer than what they are exposed to. Chomsky illustrates that humans are not exposed to all structures of their language, yet they fully achieve knowledge of these structures."
29116,stimulus generalization meaning,50745,"However, the argument that the poverty of the stimulus supports the innateness hypothesis remains controversial.  For example, Fiona Cowie claims that the Poverty of Stimulus argument fails ""on both empirical and conceptual grounds to support nativism""."
29116,stimulus generalization meaning,50746,"Bergelson & Idsardi (2009) presented adults with words drawn from an artificial language. The words contained 3 CV syllables. If the last vowel was long, then it bore stress. Otherwise, stress fell on the first syllable. This pattern is consistent with two grammars. In one grammar, a long vowel bears stress if it is the last segment in the word. This is a rule based on absolute finality. In the other grammar, a long vowel bears stress only if it is the last vowel in the word (i.e., even if it is not the last segment of the word). This is a rule based on relative finality. In natural languages stress rules make reference to relative finality but not to absolute finality. After being exposed to these words, participants were then tested to see whether they thought that a word with a long vowel in a closed syllable (CVVC) would bear stress. If it did, then that would be consistent with the relative-final grammar, but not with the absolute-final grammar. English-speaking adults (tested through computer software) were more likely to accept the words from the relative-final grammar than from the absolute-final grammar. Since the data they were exposed to was equally consistent with both grammars, and since neither rule is a rule of English, the source of this decision must have come from the participants, not from any aspect of their experience. In addition, eighth-month-old children (tested via the Headturn Preference Procedure) were found to have the same preference as adults. Given that this preference could not have come from their exposure to either the artificial language or to their native language, the researchers concluded that human language acquisition mechanisms are ""hardwired"" to lead infants towards certain generalizations, consistent with the argument for the poverty of the stimulus."
29116,stimulus generalization meaning,50747,"Generative Grammarians have extensively studied the hypothesised innate effects on language in order to provide evidence for Poverty of the Stimulus. An overarching theme in examples is that children acquire grammatical rules based on evidence that is consistent with multiple generalizations. And since children are not instructed in the grammar of their language, the gap must be filled in by properties of the learner."
29116,stimulus generalization meaning,50748,"I like this red ball and you like that one.In (2), one is interpreted as ""red ball."" However, even if a speaker intends (2) in this way, it would be difficult to distinguish that interpretation from one in which ""one"" simply meant ""ball"". This is because when a speaker refers to a red ball, they are also referring to a ball since the set of red balls is a subset of balls in general. 18-month-olds, like adults, show that they believe 'one' refers to 'red ball' and not 'ball'. The evidence available to children is systematically ambiguous between a grammar in which ""one"" refers back to Nouns and one in which ""one"" refers back to noun phrases. Despite this ambiguity, children learn the more narrow interpretation, suggesting that some property other than the input is responsible for their interpretations."
29116,stimulus generalization meaning,50749,There was much research based on generative grammar in language development during the latter half of the twentieth century. This approach was abandoned by the mainstream researchers as a result of what many scientists perceived as the problems with the Poverty of the Stimulus argument.
29117,negative words to positive words,50751,"A number of studies have suggested that negativity is essentially an attention magnet. For example, when tasked with forming an impression of presented target individuals, participants spent longer looking at negative photographs than they did looking at positive photographs. Similarly, participants registered more eye blinks when studying negative words than positive words (blinking rate has been positively linked to cognitive activity). Also, people were found to show greater orienting responses following negative than positive outcomes, including larger increases in pupil diameter, heart rate, and peripheral arterial tone Importantly, this preferential attendance to negative information is evident even when the affective nature of the stimuli is irrelevant to the task itself. The automatic vigilance hypothesis has been investigated using a modified Stroop task.  Participants were presented with a series of positive and negative personality traits in several different colors; as each trait appeared on the screen, participants were to name the color as quickly as possible.  Even though the positive and negative elements of the words were immaterial to the color-naming task, participants were slower to name the color of negative traits than they were positive traits.  This difference in response latencies indicates that greater attention was devoted to processing the trait itself when it was negative."
29117,negative words to positive words,50752,"You can see this phenomenon by taking a particularly positive or negative word and searching for the other words with the most similar weight values. In other words, you can take each word and see which other words have the most similar weight values connecting them to each hidden neuron (to each group). Words that subscribe to similar groups will have similar predictive power for positive or negative labels. As such, words that subscribe to similar groups, having similar weight values, will also have similar meaning. Abstractly, in terms of neural networks, a neuron has similar meaning to other neurons in the same layer if and only if it has similar weights connecting it to the next and/or previous layers."
29117,negative words to positive words,50753,"A halfspace for this problem assigns weights to words. It is natural to assume that by assigning positive and negative weights to a few dozen words we will be able to determine whether a given document is about sports or not with reasonable accuracy. Therefore, for this problem, the value of B2 can be set to be less than 100. Overall, it is reasonable to say that the value of B2ρ2 is smaller than 10,000."
29117,negative words to positive words,50754,"This was done by taking all 631 million words from English Wikipedia (en.wikipedia.org), and then creating windows of length 11 containing neighboring words. This constitutes the positive examples. To create negative examples, the middle word of each window was replaced by a random English word (this is likely to be an “invalid” sentence — either grammatically and/or semantically — with high probability). This neural network was then trained over the course of 1 week, and its latent representation was then used as the input to a supervised semantic role labeling task, for which very little labeled training data is available. (See also (Ando and Zhang 2005) for related work.)"

How can we predict ci from yi? There are many possible approaches, but most are direct mappings from the words to the class. In some cases, such as sentiment analysis, we can get better performance by first performing inference, to try to disambiguate the meaning of words. For example, suppose the goal is to determine if a document is a favorable review of a movie or not. If we encounter the phrase “Brad Pitt was excellent until the middle of the movie”, the word “excellent” may lead us to think the review is positive, but clearly the overall sentiment is negative."

Variety's Justin Chang commended Bateman's directorial debut and the film's ""often uproarious model of sharp scripting and spirited acting"", as well as the performances given by Chand, Hahn and Hall. Rolling Stone critic Peter Travers gave Bad Words 3.5 out of 4 stars, writing that the film was ""a tour de force of comic wickedness"" in which ""Bateman shows the same skill as a filmmaker that he does as an actor"". John DeFore opined in a review for The Hollywood Reporter that the film was ""scouringly funny"" and that Bateman showed ""the same knack for timing and fine shadings of attitude"" as both the director and the lead actor. The Los Angeles Times' Betsy Sharkey enjoyed Bad Words, summarizing it as ""high-minded, foul-mouthed good nonsense"" and ""sarcastic, sanctimonious, salacious, sly, slight and surprisingly sweet"".Negative reviews, on the other hand, mainly criticized the film's dark humor and the unlikeability of the main character. USA Today's Claudia Puig found the film ""neither believable nor funny"" and wrote that ""it's tough to summon sufficiently negative language to describe the unfunny, desperate mess that is Bad Words"". The Boston Globe critic Peter Keough gave the film 1 star out of 4, finding it unfunny, clichéd and offensive with an unlikeable ""sociopath"" as the main character. Richard Corliss of Time thought that the film failed to redeem Guy's character or justify his ""deification"", ultimately making it boring and unsatisfying. Similarly, Joe Morgenstern described Guy in a review for The Wall Street Journal as ""downright vile, a self-created pariah, and funny enough for a reasonable stretch of time"" before the plot becomes ""both implausible and banal"". The Globe and Mail's Robert Everett-Green gave Bad Words 1 out of 4 stars, deeming it ""a shallow remix"" of offensive and clichéd characters with poor acting and ""mean-spirited"" humor."

The standard test for synonymy is substitution: one form can be replaced by another in a sentence without changing its meaning. Words are considered synonymous in one particular sense: for example, long and extended in the context long time or extended time are synonymous, but long cannot be used in the phrase extended family. Synonyms with exactly the same meaning share a seme or denotational sememe, whereas those with inexactly similar meanings share a broader denotational or connotational sememe and thus overlap within a semantic field.

Many continuous variables, such as the examples just mentioned, have distributions that are bell-shaped, and these are called approximately normally distributed variables. For example, if a researcher selects a random sample of 100 adult women, measures their heights, and constructs a histogram, the researcher gets a graph similar to the one shown in Figure 6 –1(a).

To apply such models to the problem of density estimation, we need a procedure for determining suitable values for the parameters, given an observed data set.

A basic fact, known as the fundamental theorem of symmetric polynomials states that any symmetric polynomial in n variables can be given by a polynomial expression in terms of these elementary symmetric polynomials. It follows that any symmetric polynomial expression in the roots of a monic polynomial can be expressed as a polynomial in the coefficients of the polynomial, and in particular that its value lies in the base field k that contains those coefficients. Thus, when working only with such symmetric polynomial expressions in the roots, it is unnecessary to know anything particular about those roots, or to compute in any larger field than k in which those roots may lie. In fact the values of the roots themselves become rather irrelevant, and the necessary relations between coefficients and symmetric polynomial expressions can be found by computations in terms of symmetric polynomials only. An example of such relations are Newton's identities, which express the sum of any fixed power of the roots in terms of the elementary symmetric polynomials."

So, if you run your algorithm without stemming and you end up with, let's say, five percent classification error, and you re-run it and you end up with, let's say, three percent classification error, then this decrease in error very quickly allows you to decide that, you know, it looks like using stemming is a good idea.

The most popular version of subjective probability is Bayesian probability, which includes expert knowledge as well as experimental data to produce probabilities.  The expert knowledge is represented by some (subjective) prior probability distribution.  These data are incorporated in a likelihood function. The product of the prior and the likelihood, normalized, results in a posterior probability distribution that incorporates all the information known to date.

29125,probability in real life situations,50827,"A good example of the use of probability theory in equity trading is the effect of the perceived probability of any widespread Middle East conflict on oil prices, which have ripple effects in the economy as a whole. An assessment by a commodity trader that a war is more likely can send that commodity's prices up or down, and signals other traders of that opinion. Accordingly, the probabilities are neither assessed independently nor necessarily very rationally. The theory of behavioral finance emerged to describe the effect of such groupthink on pricing, on policy, and on peace and conflict.In addition to financial assessment, probability can be used to analyze trends in biology (e.g. disease spread) as well as ecology (e.g. biological Punnett squares). As with finance, risk assessment can be used as a statistical tool to calculate the likelihood of undesirable events occurring and can assist with implementing protocols to avoid encountering such circumstances. Probability is used to design games of chance so that casinos can make a guaranteed profit, yet provide payouts to players that are frequent enough to encourage continued play.The discovery of rigorous methods to assess and combine probability assessments has changed society.Another significant application of probability theory in everyday life is reliability. Many consumer products, such as automobiles and consumer electronics, use reliability theory in product design to reduce the probability of failure.

One simple extension of the linear dynamical system is to use a Gaussian mixture as the initial distribution for z1.

Thus the model has the form p(xiθ) = k=1 πkN (xiμk,Σk) (11.2) Figure 11.3 shows a mixture of 3 Gaussians in 2D. Each mixture component is represented by a different set of eliptical contours.

The rule for matrix multiplication, however, is that two matrices can be multiplied only when the number of columns in the first equals the number of rows in the second (i.e., the inner dimensions are the same, n for an (m×n)-matrix times an (n×p)-matrix, resulting in an (m×p)-matrix).

29128,logistic curve,50859,"The logistic function was introduced in a series of three papers by Pierre François Verhulst between 1838 and 1847, who devised it as a model of population growth by adjusting the exponential growth model, under the guidance of Adolphe Quetelet. Verhulst first devised the function in the mid 1830s, publishing a brief note in 1838, then presented an expanded analysis and named the function in 1844 (published 1845); the third paper adjusted the correction term in his model of Belgian population growth.The initial stage of growth is approximately exponential (geometric); then, as saturation begins, the growth slows to linear (arithmetic), and at maturity, growth stops. Verhulst did not explain the choice of the term ""logistic"" (French: logistique), but it is presumably in contrast to the logarithmic curve, and by analogy with arithmetic and geometric. His growth model is preceded by a discussion of arithmetic growth and geometric growth (whose curve he calls a logarithmic curve, instead of the modern term exponential curve), and thus ""logistic growth"" is presumably named by analogy, logistic being from Ancient Greek: λογῐστῐκός, romanized: logistikós, a traditional division of Greek mathematics. The term is unrelated to the military and management term logistics, which is instead from French: logis ""lodgings"", though some believe the Greek term also influenced logistics; see Logistics § Origin for details."

29131,statistics nominal definition,50885,"There is a general perception that statistical knowledge is all-too-frequently intentionally misused by finding ways to interpret only the data that are favorable to the presenter. A mistrust and misunderstanding of statistics is associated with the quotation, ""There are three kinds of lies: lies, damned lies, and statistics"". Misuse of statistics can be both inadvertent and intentional, and the book How to Lie with Statistics outlines a range of considerations. In an attempt to shed light on the use and misuse of statistics, reviews of statistical techniques used in particular fields are conducted (e.g. Warne, Lazo, Ramos, and Ritter (2012)).Ways to avoid misuse of statistics include using proper diagrams and avoiding bias. Misuse can occur when conclusions are overgeneralized and claimed to be representative of more than they really are, often by either deliberately or unconsciously overlooking sampling bias. Bar graphs are arguably the easiest diagrams to use and understand, and they can be made either by hand or with simple computer programs. Unfortunately, most people do not look for bias or errors, so they are not noticed. Thus, people may often believe that something is true even if it is not well represented. To make data gathered from statistics believable and accurate, the sample taken must be representative of the whole.

29132,negative words list,50892,"A number of studies have suggested that negativity is essentially an attention magnet. For example, when tasked with forming an impression of presented target individuals, participants spent longer looking at negative photographs than they did looking at positive photographs. Similarly, participants registered more eye blinks when studying negative words than positive words (blinking rate has been positively linked to cognitive activity). Also, people were found to show greater orienting responses following negative than positive outcomes, including larger increases in pupil diameter, heart rate, and peripheral arterial tone Importantly, this preferential attendance to negative information is evident even when the affective nature of the stimuli is irrelevant to the task itself. The automatic vigilance hypothesis has been investigated using a modified Stroop task.  Participants were presented with a series of positive and negative personality traits in several different colors; as each trait appeared on the screen, participants were to name the color as quickly as possible.  Even though the positive and negative elements of the words were immaterial to the color-naming task, participants were slower to name the color of negative traits than they were positive traits.  This difference in response latencies indicates that greater attention was devoted to processing the trait itself when it was negative."
29132,negative words list,50893,"Paul Rozin and Edward Royzman proposed four elements of the negativity bias in order to explain its manifestation: negative potency, steeper negative gradients, negativity dominance, and negative differentiation.Negative potency refers to the notion that, while possibly of equal magnitude or emotionality, negative and positive items/events/etc. are not equally salient.  Rozin and Royzman note that this characteristic of the negativity bias is only empirically demonstrable in situations with inherent measurability, such as comparing how positively or negatively a change in temperature is interpreted."
29132,negative words list,50894,"The negativity bias, also known as the negativity effect, is the notion that, even when of equal intensity, things of a more negative nature (e.g. unpleasant thoughts, emotions, or social interactions; harmful/traumatic events) have a greater effect on one's psychological state and processes than neutral or positive things.  In other words, something very positive will generally have less of an impact on a person's behavior and cognition than something equally emotional but negative.  The negativity bias has been investigated within many different domains, including the formation of impressions and general evaluations; attention, learning, and memory; and decision-making and risk considerations."
29132,negative words list,50895,"As an example, a famous study by Leon Festinger and colleagues investigated critical factors in predicting friendship formation; the researchers concluded that whether or not people became friends was most strongly predicted by their proximity to one another.  Ebbesen, Kjos, and Konecni, however, demonstrated that proximity itself does not predict friendship formation; rather, proximity serves to amplify the information that is relevant to the decision of either forming or not forming a friendship.  Negative information is just as amplified as positive information by proximity.  As negative information tends to outweigh positive information, proximity may predict a failure to form friendships even more so than successful friendship formation.One explanation that has been put forth as to why such a negativity bias is demonstrated in social judgments is that people may generally consider negative information to be more diagnostic of an individual's character than positive information, that it is more useful than positive information in forming an overall impression.  This is supported by indications of higher confidence in the accuracy of one's formed impression when it was formed more on the basis of negative traits than positive traits.  People consider negative information to be more important to impression formation and, when it is available to them, they are subsequently more confident."
29132,negative words list,50896,"With respect to positive and negative gradients, it appears to be the case that negative events are thought to be perceived as increasingly more negative than positive events are increasingly positive the closer one gets (spatially or temporally) to the affective event itself.  In other words, there is a steeper negative gradient than positive gradient.  For example, the negative experience of an impending dental surgery is perceived as increasingly more negative the closer one gets to the date of surgery than the positive experience of an impending party is perceived as increasingly more positive the closer one gets to the date of celebration  (assuming for the sake of this example that these events are equally positive and negative).  Rozin and Royzman argue that this characteristic is distinct from that of negative potency because there appears to be evidence of steeper negative slopes relative to positive slopes even when potency itself is low."
29132,negative words list,50897,"Negative differentiation is consistent with evidence suggesting that the conceptualization of negativity is more elaborate and complex than that of positivity.  For instance, research indicates that negative vocabulary is more richly descriptive of the affective experience than that of positive vocabulary.  Furthermore, there appear to be more terms employed to indicate negative emotions than positive emotions. The notion of negative differentiation is consistent with the mobilization-minimization hypothesis, which posits that negative events, as a consequence of this complexity, require a greater mobilization of cognitive resources to deal with the affective experience and a greater effort to minimize the consequences."
29132,negative words list,50898,"Learning and memory are direct consequences of attentional processing: the more attention is directed or devoted toward something, the more likely it is that it will be later learned and remembered.  Research concerning the effects of punishment and reward on learning suggests that punishment for incorrect responses is more effective in enhancing learning than are rewards for correct responses—learning occurs more quickly following bad events than good events.Drs. Pratto and John addressed the effects of affective information on incidental memory as well as attention using their modified Stroop paradigm (see section concerning ""Attention"").  Not only were participants slower to name the colors of negative traits, they also exhibited better incidental memory for the presented negative traits than they did for the positive traits, regardless of the proportion of negative to positive traits in the stimuli set.Intentional memory is also impacted by the stimuli's negative or positive quality.  When studying both positive and negative behaviors, participants tend to recall more negative behaviors during a later memory test than they do positive behaviors, even after controlling for serial position effects. There is also evidence that people exhibit better recognition memory and source memory for negative information.When asked to recall a recent emotional event, people tend to report negative events more often than they report positive events, and this is thought to be because these negative memories are more salient than are the positive memories.  People also tend to underestimate how frequently they experience positive affect, in that they more often forget the positively emotional experiences than they forget negatively emotional experiences."

This should give you the same way, the same answer as the other way of computing unit product. Right. Which is if you take U transpose V then U transposes this U1 U2, its a one by two matrix, 1 times V. And so this should actually give you U1, V1 plus U2, V2. And so the theorem of linear algebra that these two formulas give you the same answer. And by the way, U transpose V is also equal to V transpose U. So if you were to do the same process in reverse, instead of projecting V onto U, you could project U onto V. Then, you know, do the same process, but with the rows of U and V reversed. And you would actually, you should actually get the same number whatever that number is. And just to clarify what's going on in this equation the norm of U is a real number and P is also a real number."

So to summarize, if you plot a histogram with the data, and find that it looks pretty non-Gaussian, it's worth playing around a little bit with different transformations like these, to see if you can make your data look a little bit more Gaussian, before you feed it to your learning algorithm, although even if you don't, it might work okay.

Algorithm 2 has the second highest and algorithm 3 has the lowest and so you know, if we go by the f score, we would pick probably algorithm of 1 over the others. The f score, which is also called the f1 score, is usually written f1 score that I have here, but often people will just say f score.

Way was credited as Garry Way.In 2007, Way began writing the comic-book miniseries The Umbrella Academy. Way wrote the story and illustrated the original version, but cartoonist Gabriel Bá redrew the art in the first volume, Apocalypse Suite.Apocalypse Suite was first released by Dark Horse Comics in their Free Comic Book Day issue on May 5, 2007. Since then, an eight-page story has been published entitled ""Safe & Sound"", which appeared in a collection of stories entitled MySpace Dark Horse Presents Volume One. The first official issue of The Umbrella Academy was released on September 19, 2007. The first issue sold out and consequently there was a second printing released on October 17, 2007. Apocalypse Suite also won the 2008 Eisner Award for Best Limited Series. The next installment of the series, Dallas, was released on November 26, 2008, and, following speculation that Way had retired indefinitely from comics, a third installment entitled Hotel Oblivion was released in 2018–2019.Way and fellow artists Shaun Simon and Becky Cloonan co-created another comic-book series entitled The True Lives of the Fabulous Killjoys,  which Way announced at 2009 San Diego Comic-Con. At the 2012 New York Comic Con, the team announced that the first look at the series would be released on 2013's Free Comic Book Day.

Those alternative stemming algorithms are also available through the NLTK package (http://www.nltk.org/api/ nltk.stem.html). While stemming can create non-real words, such as thu, (from thus) as shown in the previous example, a technique called lemmatization aims to obtain the canonical (grammatically correct) forms of individual words— the so-called lemmas. However, lemmatization is computationally more difficult and expensive compared to stemming and, in practice, it has been observed that stemming and lemmatization have little impact on the performance of text classification (Michal Toman, Roman Tesar, and Karel Jezek. Influence of word normalization on text classification. Proceedings of InSciT, pages 354–358, 2006)."

Lemmas are the base forms of words that are used to key the word in a dictionary. Stemming has a similar goal to lemmatization, but it does not attempt to produce the morphological roots of words. Instead, stemming removes all patterns of characters that appear to be affixes, resulting in a token that is not necessarily a valid word. Lemmatization frequently requires a lexical resource, like WordNet, and the word's part-of-speech. Stemming algorithms frequently use rules instead of lexical resources to produce stems and can operate on any token, even without its context. Let's consider lemmatization of the word in two documents:"
29138,lemmatization and stemming,50957,"With the plain text in hand, next we need to turn it into a bag of terms. This step requires care for a couple of reasons. First, common words like the and is take up space but at best offer no useful information to the model. Filtering out a list of stop words can both save space and improve fidelity. Second, terms with the same meaning can often take slightly different forms. For example, monkey and monkeys do not deserve to be separate terms. Nor do nationalize and nationalization. Combining these different inflectional forms into single terms is called stemming or lemmatiza‐ tion. Stemming refers to heuristics-based techniques for chopping off characters at the ends of words, while lemmatization refers to more principled approaches. For example, the former might truncate drew to dr, while the latter might more correctly output draw. The Stanford Core NLP project provides an excellent lemmatizer with a Java API that Scala can take advantage of."

29140,pca for dimensionality reduction,50971,"The light points are the original data, while the dark points are the projected version. This makes clear what a PCA dimensionality reduction means: the information along the least important principal axis or axes is removed, leaving only the component(s) of the data with the highest variance. The fraction of variance that is cut out (propor‐ tional to the spread of points about the line formed in Figure 5-83) is roughly a meas‐ ure of how much “information” is discarded in this reduction of dimensionality."
29140,pca for dimensionality reduction,50972,"For instance, if PCA dimensionality reduction is applied to the data, how does an attacker know which dimensions of the input to manipulate? Similarly, if the input goes through some other unknown nonlinear transformation before being fed into a classifier, it is a lot less clear how an attacker should map changes in the raw input to points on the decision surface. As another example, some types of user input cannot be easily modified by a user interacting with the system, such as when classifier input depends on system state or properties that users have no influence over. Finally, determining how much chaff is necessary to cause a meaning‐ ful shift of the decision boundary can also be challenging."
29140,pca for dimensionality reduction,50973,"Performing dimensionality reduction after PCA is then as simple as picking out the top n principal components and representing your data in those n dimensions. In most cases, when performing PCA for the purposes of dimensionality reduction for downstream classification or processing, you should select a sufficient number of principal components to capture a large proportion of the variance in your data. For plotting purposes, however, choosing the top two principal components will often be sufficient to give a good representation for understanding the data."
29140,pca for dimensionality reduction,50974,"Principal component analysis (PCA) is the dimensionality reduction technique which has so many utilities. PCA reduces the dimensions of a dataset by projecting the data onto a lower-dimensional subspace. For example, a 2D dataset could be reduced by projecting the points onto a line. Each instance in the dataset would then be represented by a single value, rather than a pair of values. In a similar way, a 3D dataset could be reduced to two dimensions by projecting variables onto a plane."

Principal component analysis41 (PCA) is one com‐ mon dimensionality reduction method. It is difficult to explain this process accu‐ rately without diving into its mathematical formulation, but what PCA effectively does is find a set of axes (principal components) in high-dimensional space that are ordered by the amount of variance in the data that they explain, from greatest var‐ iance to smallest. It follows that projecting the dataset onto the first few axes captures most of the information in the dataset."

These videos will touch on the main issues that you may face when designing a complex machine learning system, and will actually try to give advice on how to strategize putting together a complex machine learning system. In case this next set of videos seems a little disjointed that's because these videos will touch on a range of the different issues that you may come across when designing complex learning systems. And even though the next set of videos may seem somewhat less mathematical, I think that this material may turn out to be very useful, and potentially huge time savers when you're building big machine learning systems. Concretely, I'd like to begin with the issue of prioritizing how to spend your time on what to work on, and I'll begin with an example on spam classification. Let's say you want to build a spam classifier."
29151,machine learning system design,51081,"touch on another important aspect of machine learning system design, which will often come up, which is the issue of how much data to train on. Now, in some earlier videos, I had cautioned against blindly going out and just spending lots of time collecting lots of data, because it's only sometimes that that would actually help. But it turns out that under certain conditions, and I will say in this video what those conditions are, getting a lot of data and training on a certain type of learning algorithm, can be a very effective way to get a learning algorithm to do very good performance. And this arises often enough that if those conditions hold true for your problem and if you're able to get a lot of data, this could be a very good way to get a very high performance learning algorithm. So in this video, let's talk more about that. Let me start with a story."
29151,machine learning system design,51082,"There are some design choices that a machine learning system architect can make that will make it more difficult for even motivated adversaries to poison models. Does the system really need real-time, minute-by-minute online learning capabilities, or can similar value be obtained from a daily scheduled incremental training using the previous day’s data? There are significant benefits to designing online learning sys‐ tems that behave similarly to an offline batch update system:"
29151,machine learning system design,51083,"your learning algorithm, but using PCA to prevent over-fitting, that is not a good use of PCA, and using regularization instead is really what many people would recommend doing instead. Finally, one last misuse of PCA. And so I should say PCA is a very useful algorithm, I often use it for the compression on the visualization purposes. But, what I sometimes see, is also people sometimes use PCA where it shouldn't be. So, here's a pretty common thing that I see, which is if someone is designing a machine-learning system, they may write down the plan like this: let's design a learning system. Get a training set and then, you know, what I'm going to do is run PCA, then train logistic regression and then test on my test data. So often at the very start of a project, someone will just write out a project plan than says lets do these four steps with PCA inside."

29151,machine learning system design,51085,"Machine learning, especially on large datasets, is a computationally intensive task. Scikit-learn puts out respectable performance numbers by any measure, and contrib‐ utors are constantly making performance improvements to the project. Nevertheless, this performance can still be insufficient for the demands of some applications. For security machine learning systems in critical decision paths, the end user’s tolerance for high-latency responses might be limited. In such cases, it is often a good design choice to take machine learning systems out of the main line of interaction between users and a system."
29151,machine learning system design,51086,"Vulnerabilities in machine learning systems can arise from flawed system design, fun‐ damental algorithmic limitations, or a combination of both. In this chapter, we exam‐ ine some vulnerabilities in and attacks on machine learning algorithms. We then use the knowledge gained to motivate system designs that are more resilient to attacks."
29151,machine learning system design,51087,"Security Vulnerabilities in Machine Learning Algorithms Security systems are natural targets for malicious tampering because there are often clear gains for attackers who successfully circumvent them. Systems powered by machine learning contain a fresh new attack surface that adversaries can exploit when they are furnished with background knowledge in this space. Hacking system envi‐ ronments by exploiting design or implementation flaws is nothing new, but fooling statistical models is another matter altogether. To understand the vulnerabilities of machine learning algorithms, let’s consider the how the environment in which these techniques are applied affects their performance. As an analogy, consider a swimmer who learns and practices swimming in swimming pools their entire life."

So I'm actually going to spend a lot of the time teaching you those sorts of best practices in machine learning and AI and how to get this stuff to work and how we do it, how the best people do it in Silicon Valley and around the world.

This move had a significant effect on the SE business, which went from struggling to one of the most profitable businesses in the Internet.Search engines were also known as some of the brightest stars in the Internet investing frenzy that occurred in the late 1990s. Several companies entered the market spectacularly, receiving record gains during their initial public offerings.

They can either submit one web page at a time, or they can submit the entire site using a sitemap, but it is normally only necessary to submit the home page of a web site as search engines are able to crawl a well designed website. There are two remaining reasons to submit a web site or web page to a search engine: to add an entirely new web site without waiting for a search engine to discover it, and to have a web site's record updated after a substantial redesign."
29154,internet search parameters,51115,"The thought for indexing information began as far back as 1945 in Vannevar Bush's The Atlantic Monthly article ""As We May Think"". Vannevar expressed the emphasis on information in the future and the need for scientists to design a way to incorporate information found in journals. He suggested a memory device called the Memex, used to compress and store information which could then be retrieved with speed and flexibility. Internet search engines themselves predate the debut of the Web in December 1990. The Who is user search dates back to 1982 and the Knowbot Information Service multi-network user search was first implemented in 1989. The first well documented search engine that searched content files, namely FTP files, was Archie, which debuted on 10 September 1990.Prior to September 1993, the World Wide Web was entirely indexed by hand. There was a list of webservers edited by Tim Berners-Lee and hosted on the CERN webserver. One snapshot of the list in 1992 remains, but as more and more web servers went online the central list could no longer keep up. On the NCSA site, new servers were announced under the title ""What's New!""The first tool used for searching content (as opposed to users) on the Internet was Archie. The name stands for ""archive"" without the ""v"". It was created by Alan Emtage, Bill Heelan and J. Peter Deutsch, computer science students at McGill University in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. The program downloaded the directory listings of all the files located on public anonymous FTP (File Transfer Protocol) sites, creating a searchable database of file names; however, Archie Search Engine did not index the contents of these sites since the amount of data was so limited it could be readily searched manually."

It's also possible to weight by date because each page has a modification time. Most search engines support the use of the boolean operators AND, OR and NOT to help end users refine the search query. Boolean operators are for literal searches that allow the user to refine and extend the terms of the search. The engine looks for the words or phrases exactly as entered. Some search engines provide an advanced feature called proximity search, which allows users to define the distance between keywords. There is also concept-based searching where the research involves using statistical analysis on pages containing the words or phrases you search for. As well, natural language queries allow the user to type a question in the same form one would ask it to a human. A site like this would be ask.com.The usefulness of a search engine depends on the relevance of the result set it gives back. While there may be millions of web pages that include a particular word or phrase, some pages may be more relevant, popular, or authoritative than others. Most search engines employ methods to rank the results to provide the ""best"" results first. How a search engine decides which pages are the best matches, and what order the results should be shown in, varies widely from one engine to another. The methods also change over time as Internet usage changes and new techniques evolve. There are two main types of search engine that have evolved: one is a system of predefined and hierarchically ordered keywords that humans have programmed extensively. The other is a system that generates an ""inverted index"" by analyzing texts it locates. This first form relies much more heavily on the computer itself to do the bulk of the work."

The company achieved better results for many searches with an algorithm called PageRank, as was explained in the paper Anatomy of a Search Engine written by Sergey Brin and Larry Page, the later founders of Google. This iterative algorithm ranks web pages based on the number and PageRank of other web sites and pages that link there, on the premise that good or desirable pages are linked to more than others. Larry Page's patent for PageRank cites Robin Li's earlier RankDex patent as an influence. Google also maintained a minimalist interface to its search engine. In contrast, many of its competitors embedded a search engine in a web portal. In fact, Google search engine became so popular that spoof engines emerged such as Mystery Seeker."

These biases can be a direct result of economic and commercial processes (e.g., companies that advertise with a search engine can become also more popular in its organic search results), and political processes (e.g., the removal of search results to comply with local laws). For example, Google will not surface certain neo-Nazi websites in France and Germany, where Holocaust denial is illegal."

29157,linear regression variable types,51140,"Linearity.  This means that the mean of the response variable is a linear combination of the parameters (regression coefficients) and the predictor variables.  Note that this assumption is much less restrictive than it may at first seem.  Because the predictor variables are treated as fixed values (see above), linearity is really only a restriction on the parameters.  The predictor variables themselves can be arbitrarily transformed, and in fact multiple copies of the same underlying predictor variable can be added, each one transformed differently.  This technique is used, for example, in polynomial regression, which uses linear regression to fit the response variable as an arbitrary polynomial function (up to a given rank) of a predictor variable. With this much flexibility, models such as polynomial regression often have ""too much power"", in that they tend to overfit the data.  As a result, some kind of regularization must typically be used to prevent unreasonable solutions coming out of the estimation process.  Common examples are ridge regression and lasso regression.  Bayesian linear regression can also be used, which by its nature is more or less immune to the problem of overfitting. (In fact, ridge regression and lasso regression can both be viewed as    special cases of Bayesian linear regression, with particular types of prior distributions placed on the regression coefficients.)"
29157,linear regression variable types,51141,"The distribution of the residuals largely depends on the type and distribution of the outcome variable; different types of outcome variables lead to the variety of models within the GLiM family.

This means that GLiM may be spoken of as a general family of statistical models or as specific models for specific outcome types."

If you know the slope and the y-intercept of that regression line, then you can plug in a value for X and predict the average value for Y. In other words, you predict (the average) Y from X.

29158,different problem solving techniques,51151,"Mental set was first articulated by Abraham Luchins in the 1940s and demonstrated in his well-known water jug experiments. In these experiments, participants were asked to fill one jug with a specific amount of water using only other jugs (typically three) with different maximum capacities as tools. After Luchins gave his participants a set of water jug problems that could all be solved by employing a single technique, he would then give them a problem that could either be solved using that same technique or a novel and simpler method. Luchins discovered that his participants tended to use the same technique that they had become accustomed to despite the possibility of using a simpler alternative. Thus mental set describes one's inclination to attempt to solve problems in such a way that has proved successful in previous experiences. However, as Luchins' work revealed, such methods for finding a solution that have worked in the past may not be adequate or optimal for certain new but similar problems. Therefore, it is often necessary for people to move beyond their mental sets in order to find solutions. This was again demonstrated in Norman Maier's 1931 experiment, which challenged participants to solve a problem by using a household object (pliers) in an unconventional manner. Maier observed that participants were often unable to view the object in a way that strayed from its typical use, a phenomenon regarded as a particular form of mental set (more specifically known as functional fixedness, which is the topic of the following section). When people cling rigidly to their mental sets, they are said to be experiencing fixation, a seeming obsession or preoccupation with attempted strategies that are repeatedly unsuccessful. In the late 1990s, researcher Jennifer Wiley worked to reveal that expertise can work to create a mental set in people considered to be experts in their fields, and she gained evidence that the mental set created by expertise could lead to the development of fixation."

29158,different problem solving techniques,51156,"Insight is the sudden solution to a long-vexing problem, a sudden recognition of a new idea, or a sudden understanding of a complex situation, an Aha! moment. Solutions found through insight are often more accurate than those found through step-by-step analysis. To solve more problems at a faster rate, insight is necessary for selecting productive moves at different stages of the problem-solving cycle. This problem-solving strategy pertains specifically to problems referred to as insight problem. Unlike Newell and Simon's formal definition of move problems, there has not been a generally agreed upon definition of an insight problem (Ash, Jee, and Wiley, 2012; Chronicle, MacGregor, and Ormerod, 2004; Chu and MacGregor, 2011).Blanchard-Fields looks at problem solving from one of two facets.

29158,different problem solving techniques,51158,"Problem solving in psychology refers to the process of finding solutions to problems encountered in life. Solutions to these problems are usually situation or context-specific. The process starts with problem finding and problem shaping, where the problem is discovered and simplified. The next step is to generate possible solutions and evaluate them. Finally a solution is selected to be implemented and verified. Problems have an end goal to be reached and how you get there depends upon problem orientation (problem-solving coping style and skills) and systematic analysis. Mental health professionals study the human problem solving processes using methods such as introspection, behaviorism, simulation, computer modeling, and experiment. Social psychologists look into the person-environment relationship aspect of the problem and independent and interdependent problem-solving methods. Problem solving has been defined as a higher-order cognitive process and intellectual function that requires the modulation and control of more routine or fundamental skills.Problem solving has two major domains: mathematical problem solving and personal problem solving. Both are seen in terms of some difficulty or barrier that is encountered. Empirical research shows many different strategies and factors influence everyday problem solving. Rehabilitation psychologists studying individuals with frontal lobe injuries have found that deficits in emotional control and reasoning can be re-mediated with effective rehabilitation and could improve the capacity of injured persons to resolve everyday problems. Interpersonal everyday problem solving is dependent upon the individual personal motivational and contextual components. One such component is the emotional valence of ""real-world"" problems and it can either impede or aid problem-solving performance. Researchers have focused on the role of emotions in problem solving, demonstrating that poor emotional control can disrupt focus on the target task and impede problem resolution and likely lead to negative outcomes such as fatigue, depression, and inertia. In conceptualization, human problem solving consists of two related processes: problem orientation and the motivational/attitudinal/affective approach to problematic situations and problem-solving skills. Studies conclude people's strategies cohere with their goals and stem from the natural process of comparing oneself with others."

Miscegenation was the rule between the native and the Spanish cultures and people. Juan Sebastian Elcano completed the first voyage around the world in human history, the Magellan-Elcano circumnavigation. Florida was colonised by Pedro Menéndez de Avilés when he founded St. Augustine, Florida and then defeated an attempt led by the French Captain Jean Ribault to establish a French foothold in Spanish Florida territory. St. Augustine became a strategic defensive base for Spanish ships full of gold and silver sailing to Spain. Andrés de Urdaneta discovered the tornaviaje or return route from the Philippines to Mexico, making possible the Manila galleon trading route. The Spanish once again encountered Islam, but this time in Southeast Asia and in order to incorporate the Philippines, Spanish expeditions organised from newly Christianised Mexico had invaded the Philippine territories of the Sultanate of Brunei. The Spanish considered the war with the Muslims of Brunei and the Philippines, a repeat of the Reconquista. The Spanish explorer Blas Ruiz intervened in Cambodia's succession and installed Crown Prince Barom Reachea II as puppet.As Renaissance New Monarchs, Isabella and Ferdinand centralised royal power at the expense of local nobility, and the word España, whose root is the ancient name Hispania, began to be commonly used to designate the whole of the two kingdoms."

As many as 200,000 Jews were expelled from Spain. This was followed by expulsions in 1493 in Aragonese Sicily and Portugal in 1497. The Treaty of Granada guaranteed religious tolerance towards Muslims, for a few years before Islam was outlawed in 1502 in the Kingdom of Castile and 1527 in the Kingdom of Aragon, leading to Spain's Muslim population becoming nominally Christian Moriscos. A few decades after the Morisco rebellion of Granada known as the War of the Alpujarras, a significant proportion of Spain's formerly-Muslim population was expelled, settling primarily in North Africa. From 1609–14, over 300,000 Moriscos were sent on ships to North Africa and other locations, and, of this figure, around 50,000 died resisting the expulsion, and 60,000 died on the journey.The year 1492 also marked the arrival of Christopher Columbus in the New World, during a voyage funded by Isabella. Columbus's first voyage crossed the Atlantic and reached the Caribbean Islands, beginning the European exploration and conquest of the Americas, although Columbus remained convinced that he had reached the Orient. Large numbers of indigenous Americans died in battle against the Spaniards during the conquest, while others died from various other causes. Some scholars consider the initial period of the Spanish conquest— from Columbus's first landing in the Bahamas until the middle of the sixteenth century—as marking the most egregious case of genocide in the history of mankind. The death toll may have reached some 70 million indigenous people (out of 80 million) in this period, as diseases such as smallpox, measles, influenza, and typhus, brought to the Americas by the conquest, decimated the pre-Columbian population."

The first circumnavigation of the world was carried out in 1519–1521. It was the first empire on which it was said that the sun never set. This was an Age of Discovery, with daring explorations by sea and by land, the opening-up of new trade routes across oceans, conquests and the beginnings of European colonialism. Spanish explorers brought back precious metals, spices, luxuries, and previously unknown plants, and played a leading part in transforming the European understanding of the globe. The cultural efflorescence witnessed during this period is now referred to as the Spanish Golden Age. The expansion of the empire caused immense upheaval in the Americas as the collapse of societies and empires and new diseases from Europe devastated American indigenous populations. The rise of humanism, the Counter-Reformation and new geographical discoveries and conquests raised issues that were addressed by the intellectual movement now known as the School of Salamanca, which developed the first modern theories of what are now known as international law and human rights. Juan Luis Vives was another prominent humanist during this period."

Forty-five episodes were made over four series. The Python phenomenon developed from the television series into something larger in scope and impact, including touring stage shows, films, albums, books and musicals. The Pythons' influence on comedy has been compared to the Beatles' influence on music. Regarded as an enduring icon of 1970s pop culture, their sketch show has been referred to as being ""an important moment in the evolution of television comedy"".Broadcast by the BBC between 1969 and 1974, Monty Python's Flying Circus was conceived, written and performed by its members Graham Chapman, John Cleese, Terry Gilliam, Eric Idle, Terry Jones, and Michael Palin. Loosely structured as a sketch show, but with an innovative stream-of-consciousness approach aided by Gilliam's animation, it pushed the boundaries of what was acceptable in style and content. A self-contained comedy team responsible for both writing and performing their work, the Pythons had creative control which allowed them to experiment with form and content, discarding rules of television comedy. Following their television work, they began making films, including Monty Python and the Holy Grail (1975), Life of Brian (1979) and The Meaning of Life (1983). Their influence on British comedy has been apparent for years, while in North America, it has coloured the work of cult performers from the early editions of Saturday Night Live through to more recent absurdist trends in television comedy. ""Pythonesque"" has entered the English lexicon as a result."

29164,data visualization technique,51215,"French philosopher and mathematician René Descartes and Pierre de Fermat developed analytic geometry and two-dimensional coordinate system which heavily influenced the practical methods of displaying and calculating values. Fermat and Blaise Pascal's work on statistics and probability theory laid the groundwork for what we now conceptualize as data. According to the Interaction Design Foundation, these developments allowed and helped William Playfair, who saw potential for graphical communication of quantitative data, to generate and develop graphical methods of statistics.  In the second half of the 20th century, Jacques Bertin used quantitative graphs to represent information ""intuitively, clearly, accurately, and efficiently"".John Tukey and Edward Tufte pushed the bounds of data visualization; Tukey with his new statistical approach of exploratory data analysis and Tufte with his book ""The Visual Display of Quantitative Information"" paved the way for refining data visualization techniques for more than statisticians. With the progression of technology came the progression of data visualization; starting with hand drawn visualizations and evolving into more technical applications – including interactive designs leading to software visualization.Programs like SAS, SOFA, R, Minitab, Cornerstone and more allow for data visualization in the field of statistics. Other data visualization applications, more focused and unique to individuals, programming languages such as D3, Python and JavaScript help to make the visualization of quantitative data a possibility.  Private schools have also developed programs to meet the demand for learning data visualization and associated programming libraries, including free programs like The Data Incubator or paid programs like General Assembly.Beginning with the Symposium ""Data to Discovery"" in 2013, ArtCenter College of Design, Caltech and JPL in Pasadena have run an annual program on Interactive Data Visualization. The program asks: How can interactive data visualization help scientists and engineers explore their data more effectively? How can computing, design, and design thinking help maximize research results? What methodologies are most effective for leveraging knowledge from these fields? By encoding relational information with appropriate visual and interactive characteristics to help interrogate, and ultimately gain new insight into data, the program develops new interdisciplinary approaches to complex science problems, leveraging design thinking and the latest methods from computing, User-Centered Design, interaction design and 3D graphics."
29164,data visualization technique,51216,"Data visualization refers to the techniques used to communicate data or information by encoding it as visual objects (e.g., points, lines or bars) contained in graphics. The goal is to communicate information clearly and efficiently to users. It is one of the steps in data analysis or data science. According to Vitaly Friedman (2008) the ""main goal of data visualization is to communicate information clearly and effectively through graphical means. It doesn't mean that data visualization needs to look boring to be functional or extremely sophisticated to look beautiful. To convey ideas effectively, both aesthetic form and functionality need to go hand in hand, providing insights into a rather sparse and complex data set by communicating its key-aspects in a more intuitive way. Yet designers often fail to achieve a balance between form and function, creating gorgeous data visualizations which fail to serve their main purpose — to communicate information"".Indeed, Fernanda Viegas and Martin M. Wattenberg suggested that an ideal visualization should not only communicate clearly, but stimulate viewer engagement and attention.Data visualization is closely related to information graphics, information visualization, scientific visualization, exploratory data analysis and statistical graphics. In the new millennium, data visualization has become an active area of research, teaching and development. According to Post et al. (2002), it has united scientific and information visualization."
29164,data visualization technique,51217,"As a subject in computer science, scientific visualization is the use of interactive, sensory representations, typically visual, of abstract data to reinforce cognition, hypothesis building, and reasoning. Data visualization is a related subcategory of visualization dealing with statistical graphics and geographic or spatial data (as in thematic cartography) that is abstracted in schematic form.Scientific visualization is the transformation, selection, or representation of data from simulations or experiments, with an implicit or explicit geometric structure, to allow the exploration, analysis, and understanding of the data. Scientific visualization focuses and emphasizes the representation of higher order data using primarily graphics and animation techniques. It is a very important part of visualization and maybe the first one, as the visualization of experiments and phenomena is as old as science itself. Traditional areas of scientific visualization are flow visualization, medical visualization, astrophysical visualization, and chemical visualization. There are several different techniques to visualize scientific data, with isosurface reconstruction and direct volume rendering being the more common."

They proposed a number of projection indices for optimization, each focusing on a different departure from Gaussianity.

29167,examples of performance measures,51241,"We have discussed a variety of models, learning algorithms, and performance measures, as well as their implementations in scikit-learn. In the first chapter, we described machine learning programs as those that learn from experience to improve their performance at a task. In the subsequent chapters, we worked through examples that demonstrated some of the most common experiences, tasks, and performance measures in machine learning. We regressed the prices of pizzas onto their diameters, and classified spam and ham text messages. We used principal component analysis for facial recognition, built a random forest to block banner advertisements, and used SVMs and ANNs for optical character recognition. I hope that you will be able to use scikit-learn and this book's examples to apply machine learning to your own experiences. Thank you for reading."
29167,examples of performance measures,51242,"Most performance measures can only be calculated for a specific type of task, like classification or regression. Machine learning systems should be evaluated using performance measures that represent the costs associated with making errors in the real world.

The range of possible function approximation methods is far too large to cover all, and anyway too little is known about most of them to make a reliable evaluation or recommendation. Of necessity, we consider only a few possibilities. In the rest of this chapter we focus on function approximation methods based on gradient principles, and on linear gradient-descent methods in particular. We focus on these methods in part because we consider them to be particularly"

29167,examples of performance measures,51246,"Note that for the purpose of model selection, any of the measures could be biased and it wouldn’t affect things, as long as the bias did not change the relative performance of the methods. For example, the addition of a constant to any of the measures would not change the resulting chosen model. However, for many adaptive, nonlinear techniques (like trees), estimation of the effective number of parameters is very difficult. This makes methods like AIC impractical and leaves us with cross-validation or bootstrap as the methods of choice. A different question is: how well does each method estimate test error?"

For the checkers playing example the experience e, will be the experience of having the program play 10's of 1000's of games against itself. The task t, will be the task of playing checkers. And the performance measure p, will be the probability that it wins the next game of checkers against some new opponent.

For example, assume that you have a collection of pictures. Each picture depicts either a dog or a cat. A task could be sorting the pictures into separate collections of dog and cat photos. A program could learn to perform this task by observing pictures that have already been sorted, and it could evaluate its performance by calculating the percentage of correctly classified pictures."

Results are shown for n-step TD methods with a range of values for n and α. The performance measure for each parameter setting, shown on the vertical axis, is the square-root of the average squared error between the predictions at the end of the episode for the 19 states and their true values, then averaged over the first 10 episodes and 100 repetitions of the whole experiment (the same sets of walks were used for all parameter settings)."
29168,machine learning computer vision recognition,51251,"This article focuses on machine learning approaches to pattern recognition. Pattern recognition systems are in many cases trained from labeled ""training"" data (supervised learning), but when no labeled data are available other algorithms can be used to discover previously unknown patterns (unsupervised learning). Machine learning is strongly related to pattern recognition and originates from artificial intelligence. KDD and data mining have a larger focus on unsupervised methods and stronger connection to business use. Pattern recognition focuses more on the signal and also takes acquisition and Signal Processing into consideration. It originated in engineering, and the term is popular in the context of computer vision: a leading computer vision conference is named Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition. In pattern recognition, there may be a higher interest to formalize, explain and visualize the pattern, while machine learning traditionally focuses on maximizing the recognition rates. Yet, all of these domains have evolved substantially from their roots in artificial intelligence, engineering and statistics, and they've become increasingly similar by integrating developments and ideas from each other."

And this can either be in the context of you working by yourself on the big application Or it can be the context of a team of developers trying to build a complex application together.

This approach tries to model the way the human brain processes light and sound into vision and hearing. Some successful applications of deep learning are computer vision and speech recognition.
29168,machine learning computer vision recognition,51257,"The term machine learning was coined in 1959 by Arthur Samuel, an American IBMer and pioneer in the field of computer gaming and artificial intelligence. A representative book of the machine learning research during the 1960s was the Nilsson's book on Learning Machines, dealing mostly with machine learning for pattern classification. Interest related to pattern recognition continued into the 1970s, as described by Duda and Hart in 1973. In 1981 a report was given on using teaching strategies so that a neural network learns to recognize 40 characters (26 letters, 10 digits, and 4 special symbols) from a computer terminal.Tom M. Mitchell provided a widely quoted, more formal definition of the algorithms studied in the machine learning field: ""A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P,  improves with experience E."" This definition of the tasks in which machine learning is concerned offers a fundamentally operational definition rather than defining the field in cognitive terms. This follows Alan Turing's proposal in his paper ""Computing Machinery and Intelligence"", in which the question ""Can machines think?"" is replaced with the question ""Can machines do what we (as thinking entities) can do?""."
29168,machine learning computer vision recognition,51258,"Reinforcement learning is an area of machine learning concerned with how software agents ought to take actions in an environment so as to maximize some notion of cumulative reward. Due to its generality, the field is studied in many other disciplines, such as game theory, control theory, operations research, information theory, simulation-based optimization, multi-agent systems, swarm intelligence, statistics and genetic algorithms. In machine learning, the environment is typically represented as a Markov Decision Process (MDP). Many reinforcement learning algorithms use dynamic programming techniques. Reinforcement learning algorithms do not assume knowledge of an exact mathematical model of the MDP, and are used when exact models are infeasible. Reinforcement learning algorithms are used in autonomous vehicles or in learning to play a game against a human opponent."
29168,machine learning computer vision recognition,51259,"Association rule learning is a rule-based machine learning method for discovering relationships between variables in large databases. It is intended to identify strong rules discovered in databases using some measure of ""interestingness"".Rule-based machine learning is a general term for any machine learning method that identifies, learns, or evolves ""rules"" to store, manipulate or apply knowledge. The defining characteristic of a rule-based machine learning algorithm is the identification and utilization of a set of relational rules that collectively represent the knowledge captured by the system. This is in contrast to other machine learning algorithms that commonly identify a singular model that can be universally applied to any instance in order to make a prediction. Rule-based machine learning approaches include learning classifier systems, association rule learning, and artificial immune systems."
29169,mean square error equation,51260,"However, a terminological difference arises in the expression mean squared error (MSE). The mean squared error of a regression is a number computed from the sum of squares of the computed residuals, and not of the unobservable errors. If that sum of squares is divided by n, the number of observations, the result is the mean of the squared residuals. Since this is a biased  estimate of the variance of the unobserved errors, the bias is removed by dividing the sum of the squared residuals by df = n − p − 1, instead of n, where df is the number of degrees of freedom (n minus the number of parameters (excluding the intercept) p being estimated - 1). This forms an unbiased estimate of the variance of the unobserved errors, and is called the mean squared error.Another method to calculate the mean square of error when analyzing the variance of linear regression using a technique like that used in ANOVA (they are the same because ANOVA is a type of regression), the sum of squares of the residuals (aka sum of squares of the error) is divided by the degrees of freedom (where the degrees of freedom equal n − p − 1, where p is the number of parameters estimated in the model (one for each variable in the regression equation, not including the intercept)). One can then also calculate the mean square of the model by dividing the sum of squares of the model minus the degrees of freedom, which is just the number of parameters. Then the F value can be calculated by dividing the mean square of the model by the mean square of the error, and we can then determine significance (which is why you want the mean squares to begin with.).However, because of the behavior of the process of regression, the distributions of residuals at different data points (of the input variable) may vary even if the errors themselves are identically distributed. Concretely, in a linear regression where the errors are identically distributed, the variability of residuals of inputs in the middle of the domain will be higher than the variability of residuals at the ends of the domain: linear regressions fit endpoints better than the middle. This is also reflected in the influence functions of various data points on the regression coefficients: endpoints have more influence."

Or how many hidden layers in a deep neural network will give the best results? Or what value of k to use in k-means clustering? These seemingly arbitrary decisions can have a significant impact on a model’s efficacy. Novice practitioners typically try to avoid the complexity by using the default values provided by the machine learning library. Many mature machine learning libraries (including scikit-learn) do provide thoughtfully chosen default val‐ ues that are adequate for the majority of use cases. Nevertheless, it is not possible for a set of hyperparameters to be optimal in all scenarios."

He defined machine learning as the field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed. Samuel's claim to fame was that back in the 1950's, he wrote a checkers playing program.

So we conclude, tentatively, that the observed difference in birth weight can be partly explained by the difference in mother’s age.

Without being loaded by computer-based demands for searches, calculations, transmissions, etc., most applications are fast enough, which is why programmers may not catch performance problems during development.The response times are the times required for an application to respond to a user's actions at such a load.The second set of performance metrics measures the computational resources used by the application for the load, indicating whether there is adequate capacity to support the load, as well as possible locations of a performance bottleneck. Measurement of these quantities establishes an empirical performance baseline for the application. The baseline can then be used to detect changes in performance. Changes in performance can be correlated with external events and subsequently used to predict future changes in application performance.The use of APM is common for Web applications, which lends itself best to the more detailed monitoring techniques. In addition to measuring response time for a user, response times for components of a Web application can also be monitored to help pinpoint causes of delay. There also exist HTTP appliances that can decode transaction-specific response times at the Web server layer of the application."

If I have much higher order polynomials, then it's possible to show that you can get even more complex decision boundaries and logistic regression can be used to find the zero boundaries that may, for example, be an ellipse like that, or maybe with a different setting of the parameters, maybe you can get instead a different decision boundary that may even look like, you know, some funny shape like that. Or for even more complex examples you can also get decision boundaries that can look like, you know, more complex shapes like that.

Whereas in contrast, this regime corresponds to a high variance problem. That is, if d--the degree of polynomial--was too large for the data set that we have. And this figure gives us a clue for how to distinguish between these two cases. Concretely, for the high bias case, that is, the case of under fitting, what we find is that both the cross validation error and the training error are going to be high. So, if your algorithm is suffering from a bias problem, the training set error would be high and you may find that the cross validation error will also be high. It might be close, maybe just slightly higher then a training error. And so, if you see this combination, that's a sign that your algorithm may be suffering from high bias."

I'm going to measure j subscript cv, to see how well each of these hypothesis do on my cross validation set and then I'm going to pick the hypothesis with the lowest cross-validation error. So for this example, let's say for the sake of argument that it was my fourth order polynomial that had the lowest cross-validation error. So in that case, I'm going to pick this fourth order polynomial model and finally what this means is that that parameter d, remember d was the degree of polynomial, right d equals 2, d equals 3, up to d equals 10.

Ratios are not meaningful since 20 °C cannot be said to be ""twice as hot"" as 10 °C (unlike temperature in Kelvins), nor can multiplication/division be carried out between any two dates directly.

29176,nominal order interval ratio,51336,"In a 2004 study, Briton and colleagues conducted a study on evaluating relation of infertility to ovarian cancer. The incidence ratio of 1.98 was reported for a 95% Confidence (CI) interval with a ratio range of 1.4 to 2.6. The statistic was reported as the following in the paper: “(standardized incidence ratio = 1.98; 95% CI, 1.4–2.6).” This means that, based on the sample studied, infertile females have an ovarian cancer incidence that is 1.98 times higher than non-infertile females. Furthermore, it also means that we are 95% confident that the true incidence ratio in all the infertile female population lies in the range from 1.4 to 2.6. Therefore, there is a 5% probability that the true incidence ratio may lie out of the range of 1.4 to 2.6 values. Overall, the confidence interval provided more statistical information in that it reported the lowest and largest effects that are likely to occur for the studied variable while still providing information on the significance of the effects observed.In a 2018 study, the prevalence and disease burden of atopic dermatitis in the US Adult Population was understood with the use of 95% confidence intervals. It was reported that among 1,278 participating adults, the prevalence of atopic dermatitis was 7.3% (5.9–8.8). Furthermore, 60.1% (56.1–64.1) of participants were classified to have mild atopic dermatitis while 28.9% (25.3–32.7) had moderate and 11% (8.6–13.7) had severe. The study confirmed that there is a high prevalence and disease burden of atopic dermatitis in the population."
29176,nominal order interval ratio,51337,"A 95% confidence level does not mean that for a given realized interval there is a 95% probability that the population parameter lies within the interval (i.e., a 95% probability that the interval covers the population parameter). According to the strict frequentist interpretation, once an interval is calculated, this interval either covers the parameter value or it does not; it is no longer a matter of probability. The 95% probability relates to the reliability of the estimation procedure, not to a specific calculated interval. Neyman himself (the original proponent of confidence intervals) made this point in his original paper:""It will be noticed that in the above description, the probability statements refer to the problems of estimation with which the statistician will be concerned in the future. In fact, I have repeatedly stated that the frequency of correct results will tend to α. Consider now the case when a sample is already drawn, and the calculations have given [particular limits]. Can we say that in this particular case the probability of the true value [falling between these limits] is equal to α? The answer is obviously in the negative. The parameter is an unknown constant, and no probability statement concerning its value may be made...""Deborah Mayo expands on this further as follows:""It must be stressed, however, that having seen the value [of the data], Neyman–Pearson theory never permits one to conclude that the specific confidence interval formed covers the true value of 0 with either (1 − α)100% probability or (1 − α)100% degree of confidence. Seidenfeld's remark seems rooted in a (not uncommon) desire for Neyman–Pearson confidence intervals to provide something which they cannot legitimately provide; namely, a measure of the degree of probability, belief, or support that an unknown parameter value lies in a specific interval. Following Savage (1962), the probability that a parameter lies in a specific interval may be referred to as a measure of final precision. While a measure of final precision may seem desirable, and while confidence levels are often (wrongly) interpreted as providing such a measure, no such interpretation is warranted. Admittedly, such a misinterpretation is encouraged by the word 'confidence'.""A 95% confidence level does not mean that 95% of the sample data lie within the confidence interval."
29176,nominal order interval ratio,51338,"The ratio type takes its name from the fact that measurement is the estimation of the ratio between a magnitude of a continuous quantity and a unit magnitude of the same kind (Michell, 1997, 1999). A ratio scale possesses a meaningful (unique and non-arbitrary) zero value.  Most measurement in the physical sciences and engineering is done on ratio scales. Examples include mass, length, duration, plane angle, energy and electric charge. In contrast to interval scales, ratios are now meaningful because having a non-arbitrary zero point makes it meaningful to say, for example, that one object has ""twice the length"".  Very informally, many ratio scales can be described as specifying ""how much"" of something (i.e. an amount or magnitude) or ""how many"" (a count). The Kelvin temperature scale is a ratio scale because it has a unique, non-arbitrary zero point called absolute zero.  "

29177,problem solving in cognitive psychology,51341,"Problem solving in psychology refers to the process of finding solutions to problems encountered in life. Solutions to these problems are usually situation or context-specific. The process starts with problem finding and problem shaping, where the problem is discovered and simplified. The next step is to generate possible solutions and evaluate them. Finally a solution is selected to be implemented and verified. Problems have an end goal to be reached and how you get there depends upon problem orientation (problem-solving coping style and skills) and systematic analysis. Mental health professionals study the human problem solving processes using methods such as introspection, behaviorism, simulation, computer modeling, and experiment. Social psychologists look into the person-environment relationship aspect of the problem and independent and interdependent problem-solving methods. Problem solving has been defined as a higher-order cognitive process and intellectual function that requires the modulation and control of more routine or fundamental skills.Problem solving has two major domains: mathematical problem solving and personal problem solving. Both are seen in terms of some difficulty or barrier that is encountered. Empirical research shows many different strategies and factors influence everyday problem solving. Rehabilitation psychologists studying individuals with frontal lobe injuries have found that deficits in emotional control and reasoning can be re-mediated with effective rehabilitation and could improve the capacity of injured persons to resolve everyday problems. Interpersonal everyday problem solving is dependent upon the individual personal motivational and contextual components. One such component is the emotional valence of ""real-world"" problems and it can either impede or aid problem-solving performance. Researchers have focused on the role of emotions in problem solving, demonstrating that poor emotional control can disrupt focus on the target task and impede problem resolution and likely lead to negative outcomes such as fatigue, depression, and inertia. In conceptualization, human problem solving consists of two related processes: problem orientation and the motivational/attitudinal/affective approach to problematic situations and problem-solving skills. Studies conclude people's strategies cohere with their goals and stem from the natural process of comparing oneself with others."
29177,problem solving in cognitive psychology,51342,"The early experimental work of the Gestaltists in Germany placed the beginning of problem solving study (e.g., Karl Duncker in 1935 with his book The psychology of productive thinking). Later this experimental work continued through the 1960s and early 1970s with research conducted on relatively simple (but novel for participants) laboratory tasks of problem solving. The use of simple, novel tasks was due to the clearly defined optimal solutions and short time for solving, which made it possible for the researchers to trace participants' steps in problem-solving process. Researchers' underlying assumption was that simple tasks such as the Tower of Hanoi correspond to the main properties of ""real world"" problems and thus the characteristic cognitive processes within participants' attempts to solve simple problems are the same for ""real world"" problems too; simple problems were used for reasons of convenience and with the expectation that thought generalizations to more complex problems would become possible. Perhaps the best-known and most impressive example of this line of research is the work by Allen Newell and Herbert A. Simon. Other experts have shown that the principle of decomposition improves the ability of the problem solver to make good judgment."
29177,problem solving in cognitive psychology,51343,"Insight is the sudden solution to a long-vexing problem, a sudden recognition of a new idea, or a sudden understanding of a complex situation, an Aha! moment. Solutions found through insight are often more accurate than those found through step-by-step analysis. To solve more problems at a faster rate, insight is necessary for selecting productive moves at different stages of the problem-solving cycle. This problem-solving strategy pertains specifically to problems referred to as insight problem. Unlike Newell and Simon's formal definition of move problems, there has not been a generally agreed upon definition of an insight problem (Ash, Jee, and Wiley, 2012; Chronicle, MacGregor, and Ormerod, 2004; Chu and MacGregor, 2011).Blanchard-Fields looks at problem solving from one of two facets. The first looking at those problems that only have one solution (like mathematical problems, or fact-based questions) which are grounded in psychometric intelligence. The other is socioemotional in nature and have answers that change constantly (like what's your favorite color or what you should get someone for Christmas)."
29177,problem solving in cognitive psychology,51344,"Albert Einstein believed that much problem solving goes on unconsciously, and the person must then figure out and formulate consciously what the mindbrain has already solved. He believed this was his process in formulating the theory of relativity: ""The creator of the problem possesses the solution."" Einstein said that he did his problem-solving without words, mostly in images. ""The words or the language, as they are written or spoken, do not seem to play any role in my mechanism of thought. The psychical entities which seem to serve as elements in thought are certain signs and more or less clear images which can be 'voluntarily' reproduced and combined."""
29177,problem solving in cognitive psychology,51345,"Collaborative problem solving is about people working together face-to-face or in online workspaces with a focus on solving real world problems. These groups are made up of members that share a common concern, a similar passion, and/or a commitment to their work. Members are willing to ask questions, wonder, and try to understand common issues. They share expertise, experiences, tools, and methods. These groups can be assigned by instructors, or may be student regulated based on the individual student needs. The groups, or group members, may be fluid based on need, or may only occur temporarily to finish an assigned task. They may also be more permanent in nature depending on the needs of the learners. All members of the group must have some input into the decision making process and have a role in the learning process. Group members are responsible for the thinking, teaching, and monitoring of all members in the group. Group work must be coordinated among its members so that each member makes an equal contribution to the whole work. Group members must identify and build on their individual strengths so that everyone can make a significant contribution to the task. Collaborative groups require joint intellectual efforts between the members and involve social interactions to solve problems together. The knowledge shared during these interactions is acquired during communication, negotiation, and production of materials. Members actively seek information from others by asking questions. The capacity to use questions to acquire new information increases understanding and the ability to solve problems. Collaborative group work has the ability to promote critical thinking skills, problem solving skills, social skills, and self-esteem. By using collaboration and communication, members often learn from one another and construct meaningful knowledge that often leads to better learning outcomes than individual work.In a 1962 research report, Douglas Engelbart linked collective intelligence to organizational effectiveness, and predicted that pro-actively 'augmenting human intellect' would yield a multiplier effect in group problem solving: ""Three people working together in this augmented mode [would] seem to be more than three times as effective in solving a complex problem as is one augmented person working alone"".Henry Jenkins, a key theorist of new media and media convergence draws on the theory that collective intelligence can be attributed to media convergence and participatory culture. He criticizes contemporary education for failing to incorporate online trends of collective problem solving into the classroom, stating ""whereas a collective intelligence community encourages ownership of work as a group, schools grade individuals"". Jenkins argues that interaction within a knowledge community builds vital skills for young people, and teamwork through collective intelligence communities contributes to the development of such skills.Collective impact is the commitment of a group of actors from different sectors to a common agenda for solving a specific social problem, using a structured form of collaboration."

Some refer to this as the ""problem-solving cycle"". In this cycle one will recognize the problem, define the problem, develop a strategy to fix the problem, organize the knowledge of the problem cycle, figure out the resources at the user's disposal, monitor one's progress, and evaluate the solution for accuracy. The reason it is called a cycle is that once one is completed with a problem another will usually pop up."

29179,how to validate survey data,51361,"Survey methodology as a scientific field seeks to identify principles about the sample design, data collection instruments, statistical adjustment of data, and data processing, and final data analysis that can create systematic and random survey errors. Survey errors are sometimes analyzed in connection with survey cost. Cost constraints are sometimes framed as improving quality within cost constraints, or alternatively, reducing costs for a fixed level of quality. Survey methodology is both a scientific field and a profession, meaning that some professionals in the field focus on survey errors empirically and others design surveys to reduce them. For survey designers, the task involves making a large set of decisions about thousands of individual features of a survey in order to improve it.The most important methodological challenges of a survey methodologist include making decisions on how to:"
29179,how to validate survey data,51362,"A single survey is made of at least a sample (or full population in the case of a census), a method of data collection (e.g., a questionnaire) and individual questions or items that become data that can be analyzed statistically. A single survey may focus on different types of topics such as preferences (e.g., for a presidential candidate), opinions (e.g., should abortion be legal?), behavior (smoking and alcohol use), or factual information (e.g., income), depending on its purpose. Since survey research is almost always based on a sample of the population, the success of the research is dependent on the representativeness of the sample with respect to a target population of interest to the researcher. That target population can range from the general population of a given country to specific groups of people within that country, to a membership list of a professional organization, or list of students enrolled in a school system  (see also sampling (statistics) and survey sampling). The persons replying to a survey are called respondents, and depending on the questions asked their answers may represent themselves as individuals, their households, employers, or other organization they represent."
29179,how to validate survey data,51363,"This method, also known as Monte Carlo cross-validation, creates multiple random splits of the dataset into training and validation data. For each such split, the model is fit to the training data, and predictive accuracy is assessed using the validation data. The results are then averaged over the splits. The advantage of this method (over k-fold cross validation) is that the proportion of the training/validation split is not dependent on the number of iterations (i.e., the number of partitions). The disadvantage of this method is that some observations may never be selected in the validation subsample, whereas others may be selected more than once. In other words, validation subsets may overlap. This method also exhibits Monte Carlo variation, meaning that the results will vary if the analysis is repeated with different random splits."

Then, one by one, one of the remaining sets is used as a validation set and the other k - 2 sets are used as training sets until all possible combinations have been evaluated. Similar to the k*l-fold cross validation, the training set is used for model fitting and the validation set is used for model evaluation for each of the hyperparameter sets. Finally, for the selected parameter set, the test set is used to evaluate the model with the best parameter set. Here, two variants are possible: either evaluating the model that was trained on the training set or evaluating a new model that was fit on the combination of the train and the validation set."
29179,how to validate survey data,51365,"For example, setting k = 2 results in 2-fold cross-validation. In 2-fold cross-validation, we randomly shuffle the dataset into two sets d0 and d1, so that both sets are equal size (this is usually implemented by shuffling the data array and then splitting it in two). We then train on d0 and validate on d1, followed by training on d1 and validating on d0."
29179,how to validate survey data,51366,"In k-fold cross-validation, the original sample is randomly partitioned into k equal sized subsamples. Of the k subsamples, a single subsample is retained as the validation data for testing the model, and the remaining k − 1 subsamples are used as training data. The cross-validation process is then repeated k times, with each of the k subsamples used exactly once as the validation data.  The k results can then be averaged to produce a single estimation. The advantage of this method over repeated random sub-sampling  (see below) is that all observations are used for both training and validation, and each observation is used for validation exactly once. 10-fold cross-validation is commonly used, but in general k remains an unfixed parameter."

29179,how to validate survey data,51368,"The user, rather than the database itself, typically initiates data curation and maintains metadata. According to the University of Illinois' Graduate School of Library and Information Science, ""Data curation is the active and on-going management of data through its lifecycle of interest and usefulness to scholarship, science, and education; curation activities enable data discovery and retrieval, maintain quality, add value, and provide for re-use over time.""  The data curation workflow is distinct from data quality management, data protection, lifecycle management and data movement.Census data has been available in tabulated punch card form since the early 20th century and has been electronic since the 1960s. The Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research (ICPSR) web site marks 1962 as the date of their first Survey Data Archive.Deep background on data libraries appeared in a 1982 issue of the Illinois journal, Library Trends. For historical background on the data archive movement, see ""Social Scientific Information Needs for Numeric Data: The Evolution of the International Data Archive Infrastructure.""  The exact curation process undertaken within any organisation depends on the volume of data, how much noise the data contains and what the expected future use of the data means to its dissemination.The crises in space data led to the 1999 creation of the Open Archival Information System (OAIS) model, stewarded by the Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems (CCSDS), which was formed in 1982.The term data curation is sometimes used in the context of biological databases, where specific biological information is firstly obtained from a range of research articles and then stored within a specific category of database. For instance, information about anti-depressant drugs can be obtained from various sources and, after checking whether they are available as a database or not, they are saved under a drug's database's anti-depressive category. Enterprises are also utilizing data curation within their operational and strategic processes to ensure data quality and accuracy."

Note however that in reality, the total variance of the mean depends on the unknown variance, and the sum of squared deviations that goes into the variance prior (appears to) depend on the unknown mean.  In practice, the latter dependence is relatively unimportant: Shifting the actual mean shifts the generated points by an equal amount, and on average the squared deviations will remain the same.  This is not the case, however, with the total variance of the mean: As the unknown variance increases, the total variance of the mean will increase proportionately, and we would like to capture this dependence."

This number serves as a scaling parameter on the variance, making it possible to control the overall variance of the mean relative to the actual variance parameter.  The prior for the variance also has two hyperparameters, one specifying the sum of squared deviations of the pseudo-observations associated with the prior, and another specifying once again the number of pseudo-observations.  Note that each of the priors has a hyperparameter specifying the number of pseudo-observations, and in each case this controls the relative variance of that prior.  These are given as two separate hyperparameters so that the variance (aka the confidence) of the two priors can be controlled separately."

It is intended to identify strong rules discovered in databases using some measure of ""interestingness"".Rule-based machine learning is a general term for any machine learning method that identifies, learns, or evolves ""rules"" to store, manipulate or apply knowledge. The defining characteristic of a rule-based machine learning algorithm is the identification and utilization of a set of relational rules that collectively represent the knowledge captured by the system. This is in contrast to other machine learning algorithms that commonly identify a singular model that can be universally applied to any instance in order to make a prediction.

29184,machine learning applications in education,51412,"Reinforcement learning is an area of machine learning concerned with how software agents ought to take actions in an environment so as to maximize some notion of cumulative reward. Due to its generality, the field is studied in many other disciplines, such as game theory, control theory, operations research, information theory, simulation-based optimization, multi-agent systems, swarm intelligence, statistics and genetic algorithms. In machine learning, the environment is typically represented as a Markov Decision Process (MDP). Many reinforcement learning algorithms use dynamic programming techniques. Reinforcement learning algorithms do not assume knowledge of an exact mathematical model of the MDP, and are used when exact models are infeasible. Reinforcement learning algorithms are used in autonomous vehicles or in learning to play a game against a human opponent."
29184,machine learning applications in education,51413,"Reinforcement learning: A computer program interacts with a dynamic environment in which it must perform a certain goal (such as driving a vehicle or playing a game against an opponent).

For example topic modeling, dimensionality reduction or meta learning.As of 2020, deep learning has become the dominant approach for much ongoing work in the field of machine learning."
29184,machine learning applications in education,51414,"Feature learning can be either supervised or unsupervised. In supervised feature learning, features are learned using labeled input data. Examples include artificial neural networks, multilayer perceptrons, and supervised dictionary learning. In unsupervised feature learning, features are learned with unlabeled input data.  Examples include dictionary learning, independent component analysis, autoencoders, matrix factorization and various forms of clustering.Manifold learning algorithms attempt to do so under the constraint that the learned representation is low-dimensional. Sparse coding algorithms attempt to do so under the constraint that the learned representation is sparse, meaning that the mathematical model has many zeros. Multilinear subspace learning algorithms aim to learn low-dimensional representations directly from tensor representations for multidimensional data, without reshaping them into higher-dimensional vectors. Deep learning algorithms discover multiple levels of representation, or a hierarchy of features, with higher-level, more abstract features defined in terms of (or generating) lower-level features. It has been argued that an intelligent machine is one that learns a representation that disentangles the underlying factors of variation that explain the observed data.Feature learning is motivated by the fact that machine learning tasks such as classification often require input that is mathematically and computationally convenient to process. However, real-world data such as images, video, and sensory data has not yielded to attempts to algorithmically define specific features. An alternative is to discover such features or representations through examination, without relying on explicit algorithms."

29184,machine learning applications in education,51417,"Transfer of learning is the idea that what one learns in school somehow carries over to situations different from that particular time and that particular setting. Transfer was amongst the first phenomena tested in educational psychology. Edward Lee Thorndike was a pioneer in transfer research. He found that though transfer is extremely important for learning, it is a rarely occurring phenomenon. In fact, he held an experiment where he had the subjects estimate the size of a specific shape and then he would switch the shape. He found that the prior information did not help the subjects; instead it impeded their learning.One explanation of why transfer does not occur often involves surface structure and deep structure. The surface structure is the way a problem is framed. The deep structure is the steps for the solution. For example, when a math story problem changes contexts from asking how much it costs to reseed a lawn to how much it costs to varnish a table, they have different surface structures, but the steps for getting the answers are the same. However, many people are more influenced by the surface structure. In reality, the surface structure is unimportant. Nonetheless, people are concerned with it because they believe that it provides background knowledge on how to do the problem. Consequently, this interferes with their understanding of the deep structure of the problem. Even if somebody tries to concentrate on the deep structure, transfer still may be unsuccessful because the deep structure is not usually obvious. Therefore, surface structure gets in the way of people's ability to see the deep structure of the problem and transfer the knowledge they have learned to come up with a solution to a new problem.Current learning pedagogies focus on conveying rote knowledge, independent of the context that gives it meaning. Because of this, students often struggle to transfer this stand-alone information into other aspects of their education. Students need much more than abstract concepts and self-contained knowledge; they need to be exposed to learning that is practiced in the context of authentic activity and culture. Critics of situated cognition, however, would argue that by discrediting stand-alone information, the transfer of knowledge across contextual boundaries becomes impossible. There must be a balance between situating knowledge while also grasping the deep structure of material, or the understanding of how one arrives to know such information.Some theorists argue that transfer does not even occur at all. They believe that students transform what they have learned into the new context. They say that transfer is too much of a passive notion. They believe students, instead, transform their knowledge in an active way. Students don't simply carry over knowledge from the classroom, but they construct the knowledge in a way that they can understand it themselves. The learner changes the information they have learned to make it best adapt to the changing contexts that they use the knowledge in. This transformation process can occur when a learner feels motivated to use the knowledge—however, if the student does not find the transformation necessary, it is less likely that the knowledge will ever transform"
29184,machine learning applications in education,51418,"There has been a lot of research done in identifying the learning effectiveness in game based learning. Learner characteristics and cognitive learning outcomes have been identified as the key factors in research on the implementation of games in educational settings. In the process of learning a language through an online game, there is a strong relationship between the learner's prior knowledge of that language and their cognitive learning outcomes. For the people with prior knowledge of the language, the learning effectiveness of the games is much more than those with none or less knowledge of the language."
29184,machine learning applications in education,51419,"There are many different conditions that influence transfer of learning in the classroom. These conditions include features of the task, features of the learner, features of the organization and social context of the activity. The features of the task include practicing through simulations, problem-based learning, and knowledge and skills for implementing new plans. The features of learners include their ability to reflect on past experiences, their ability to participate in group discussions, practice skills, and participate in written discussions. All the unique features contribute to a student's ability to use transfer of learning. There are structural techniques that can aid learning transfer in the classroom. These structural strategies include hugging and bridging.Hugging uses the technique of simulating an activity to encourage reflexive learning. An example of the hugging strategy is when a student practices teaching a lesson or when a student role plays with another student. These examples encourage critical thinking that engages the student and helps them understand what they are learning—one of the goals of transfer of learning and desirable difficulties."
