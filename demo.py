In machine learning, the hinge loss is a loss function used for training classifiers. The hinge loss is used for "maximum-margin" classification, most notably for support vector machines (SVMs).[1]
For an intended output t = Â±1 and a classifier score y, the hinge loss of the prediction y is defined as:
{\displaystyle \ell (y)=\max(0,1-t\cdot y)}\ell(y) = \max(0, 1-t \cdot y) 
Note that {\displaystyle y}y should be the "raw" output of the classifier's decision function, not the predicted class label. For instance, in linear SVMs, {\displaystyle y=\mathbf {w} \cdot \mathbf {x} +b}y = \mathbf{w} \cdot \mathbf{x} + b, where {\displaystyle (\mathbf {w} ,b)}(\mathbf{w},b) are the parameters of the hyperplane and {\displaystyle \mathbf {x} }\mathbf {x}  is the input variable(s).
